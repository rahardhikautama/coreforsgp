"1","Democracy, Economic Development, and Income Inequality","Edward N. Muller",1988,"Most cross-national tests of inverse association between democracy and inequality have operationalized the concept of democracy by measuring its level at a single point in time. More compelling theoretical arguments can be made for causal relationships that operate over time between (1) a country's years of democratic experience and income inequality; and (2) income inequality and the stability of democracy. Continuous and qualitative measures of years of democratic experience are estimated to have a significant negative impact on income inequality independent of economic development and other control variables for a sample of 55 countries. A very strong inverse correlation is also observed between income inequality and regime stability for a sample of 33 democracies. This association holds independent of economic development, which is found to have no direct effect on democratic stability after controlling for income inequality.","10.2307/2095732","American Sociological Review","Income inequality metrics; Economics; Social inequality; Sample (statistics); Inequality; Economic growth; Economic inequality; Income distribution; Democracy; Operationalization","en",473,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2095732.pdf",4,"Analyzed the long-term relationship between years of democratic experience and income inequality across 55 countries, and between inequality and regime stability in 33 democracies.","Countries with more years of democratic experience had significantly lower income inequality, and higher inequality was strongly linked to lower regime stability.","Strengthen democratic institutions under income poverty policy to reduce inequality and enhance political stability.","Income poverty",NA
"2","Nonmarital First Births, Marriage, and Income Inequality.","Andrew J. Cherlin; David C. Ribar; Suzumi Yasutake",2016,"Many aggregate-level studies suggest a relationship between economic inequality and socio-demographic outcomes such as family formation, health, and mortality; but individual-level evidence is lacking. Nor is there satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect. We study the determinants of transitions to a nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among unmarried, childless young adults in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. We include measures of county-group-level household income inequality and of the availability of jobs typically held by high-school graduates and which pay above-poverty wages. We find that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. The association between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be partially accounted for by the availability of jobs of the type we measured. Some models also suggest that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to a first birth while cohabiting.","10.1177/0003122416653112","American sociological review","Labour economics; Economics; National Longitudinal Surveys; Young adult; Single parent; Context (language use); Household income; Demographic economics; Inequality; Economic inequality; Cohort","en",37,"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122416653112",6,"Used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997–2011) to analyze how local income inequality and job availability affect pathways to parenthood among unmarried young adults.","Higher income inequality reduced the likelihood of transitioning to marriage before a first birth, with job availability partially mediating this effect.","Target job creation policies to mitigate income poverty’s impact on family formation and support stable parenthood pathways.","Income poverty","Family; inequality; labor market; marriage; nonmarital births"

"4","ADVANCED CAPITALISM AND BLACK /WHITE RACE RELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES: A SPLIT LABOR MARKET INTERPRETATION","Edna Bonacich",1976,"A distinguishing feature of the black position in advanced capitalism lies in relatively high unemployment and underemployment, a phenomenon that emerged in the 1930s and became firmly entrenched in the mid-1950s. To explain this we examined the black/white split labor market between World War I and the New Deal, showing how blacks were used to undermine white workers and their unions. The conflict was resolved with New Deal Labor legislation, protecting the unions and outlawing undercutting. This permitted a coalition to emerge between black and white workers. But in the long run the rising cost of labor drove capital to seek cheaper labor overseas, to make use of internal pockets of unprotected labor or to automate. All three processes hurt black industrial workers disproportionately, leaving a group of hardcore unemployed in the ghettos.","10.2307/2094371","American Sociological Review","Labour economics; Economics; Split labor market theory; Position (finance); Underemployment; New Deal; Legislation; Advanced capitalism; White (horse); Capital (economics)","en",336,"https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=12995288",9,"Traced historical black/white labor dynamics in the U.S. from WWI to the post-New Deal era to explain persistent black unemployment in advanced capitalism.","Black workers were disproportionately harmed by labor cost-cutting strategies like offshoring, automation, and exploitation of unprotected labor.","Revise labor market protections under employment policy to prevent structural unemployment among historically marginalized racial groups.","Employment",NA
"5","The effect of changes in intraracial income inequality and educational attainment on changes in arrest rates for African Americans and Whites, 1957 to 1990","Gary LaFree; Kriss A. Drass",1996,"Rapid increases in crime in the United States in the 1960s and early 1970s have been puzzling in that they seem to coincide with economic growth and increased educational opportunity for disadvantaged groups, especially African Americans. We argue that these increases in crime may be more understandable in their historical context: Much of the economic expansion during the postwar period and the unprecedented gains in educational attainment for African Americans were accompanied by growing intraracial income inequality. Our annual time-series analysis of African American and White robbery, burglary, and homicide arrest rates from 1957 to 1990 confirms that intraracial income inequality is a consistent predictor of changes in arrest rates for both African Americans and Whites. An interaction analysis of dummy variables indicates that the relationship between education and crime for African Americans and Whites is contingent on levels of intraracial income inequality. For African Americans, increasing educational attainment is associated with rising arrest rates, but only during periods of growing income inequality; for Whites, increasing educational attainment is associated with reduced crime rates, but only during periods of declining inequality.

"6","Childhood Disadvantage and Health Problems in Middle and Later Life: Early Imprints on Physical Health?","Kenneth F. Ferraro; Markus H. Schafer; Lindsay R. Wilkinson",2015,"Drawing from cumulative inequality theory, we examine the relationship between childhood disadvantage and health problems in adulthood. Using two waves of data from Midlife Development in the United States, we investigate whether childhood disadvantage is associated with adult disadvantage, including fewer social resources, and the effect of lifelong disadvantage on health problems measured at the baseline survey and a 10-year follow-up. Findings reveal that childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and frequent abuse by parents are generally associated with fewer adult social resources and more lifestyle risks. Health problems, in turn, are affected by childhood disadvantage and by lifestyle risks, especially smoking and obesity. Not only was early disadvantage related to health problems at the baseline survey, but childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and frequent abuse also were related to the development of new health problems at the follow-up survey. These findings reveal the imprint of early disadvantage on health decades later and suggest greater attention to resources, even during midlife, can interrupt the chain of risks.","10.1177/0003122415619617","American sociological review","Developmental psychology; Psychology; Life course approach; Disadvantage; Socioeconomic disadvantage; Social resource; Physical health; Health problems; Inequality; Obesity; Gerontology","en",253,"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415619617?rss=1",11,"Used two waves of MIDUS data to examine how childhood disadvantage and abuse affect health problems in middle and later life.","Childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and abuse were linked to fewer social resources, more lifestyle risks, and worse long-term health outcomes.","Prioritize early interventions under child poverty policy to disrupt lifelong health inequalities rooted in early disadvantage.","Child poverty","childhood adversity; cumulative inequality; health; life course"
"7","The Local Welfare State: Two Strategies for Social Domination in Urban Imperial Germany","George Steinmetz",1990,"Poor relief and unemployment insurance were two social policies that provided aid to jobless workers in urban Imperial Germany (1871-1914). What determined the marked variation in poor relief spending by German cities? Why did some urban elites adopt aform of subsidized unemployment insurance that strengthened socialist trade unions? The local welfare state is interpreted as an object of social conflict and an instrument of elite social domination. The social-political efforts of local elites are seen as embedded within three different, coexisting images of society: (1) an older social discourse that depicted the state and elites as confronting an undifferentiated mass of disorderly poor; (2) a paradigm emerging during the second half of the nineteenth century that focused on the ""worker question"" while discouraging workers from organizing and participating in social policy; and (3) aforward-looking, ""proto-corporatist"" discourse in which organized labor is brought into social administration in exchange for social peace. Because elites viewed poor-relief policy within the older social framework, relief spending increased in response to violent protests. Situated within the emergent proto-corporatistframework, municipal unemployment insurance was more likely to be introduced where the Social Democratic Party participated in local government but was not an extraparliamentary threat. The analysis also suggests that state capacities, such as the size and complexity of the bureaucracy, are not independent causal factors, but instead mediate the impact of other causal variables.","10.2307/2095753","American Sociological Review","Welfare state; Political economy; Political science; Social policy; State (polity); Unemployment; Poor relief; Social Democratic Party; Market economy; Bureaucracy; Social conflict","en",21,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095753",12,"Examined poor relief and unemployment insurance policies across German cities (1871–1914) to understand elite strategies in managing social unrest.","Cities introduced unemployment insurance where labor was politically integrated, while poor relief increased mainly in response to unrest.","Integrate organized labor into social protection policymaking to promote inclusive governance and reduce conflict.","Employment; Social protection",NA
"8","Competition, Scale and Political Explanations for Inequality: An Integrated Study of Sectoral Explanations at the Aggregate Level","David Jacobs",1982,"Explanations from the sectoral and political traditions are used in panel analyses to predict income inequality in the American states. Sectoral explanations which stress competition and the size of the employing unit are represented by a weighted index of concentration in manufacturing and by the percentage of workers in small enterprises. Democracy and the corresponding ability of those with low incomes to influence political outcomes is gauged with indicators of political competition and voting. With four additional factors controlled, the most consistent predictor of inequality is the degree of competition. States with more black residents and greater proportions of the work force in small establishments were also likely to have comparatively unequal income distributions. These results widen the impact of the sectoral argument and show that institutional arrangements in the economy have important effects on aggregate inequality in one highly industrial society.","10.2307/2095161","American Sociological Review","Labour economics; Economics; Competition (economics); Industrial society; Inequality; Economic inequality; Voting; Democracy; Scale (social sciences); Politics","en",19,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095161",13,"Used panel data from U.S. states to assess how sectoral economic structure and political factors influence income inequality.","Lower market competition and higher proportions of workers in small firms were strongly linked to higher income inequality.","Expand antitrust and small business regulation under income poverty policy to address structural drivers of inequality.","Income poverty",NA
"9","The Public Economy and Economic Growth in Western Market Economies","Roger Friedland; Jimy M. Sanders",1985,"This essay analyzes the impact of two welfare states-one for households and the other forfirms-on economic growth in twelve advanced market economies between 1962 and 1983. We find that both welfare states contain stimulative and depressing forms of spending. Transfers in support of household income stimulate growth, while public production of goods and services largely consumed by households depresses growth. Transfers to firms may have a predominantly negative impact on growth, while military spending has a stimulative impact on the economy. We also find that increasing household tax burdens, a correlate of postwar welfare-state expansion, slows economic growth. National debates about economic growth have increasingly been structured as zero-sum choices between the welfare state for households and economic growth. This reasoning neglects the potentially stimulative components of the welfare state for households, and ignores the potentially negative impact of the welfare state forfirms.","10.2307/2095431","American Sociological Review","Welfare; Economic efficiency; Nonmarket forces; Welfare state; Economy; Economics; Economic interventionism; Planned economy; Household income; Market economy; Mixed economy","en",49,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095431",14,"Analyzed the economic impact of household and firm-focused welfare spending in 12 advanced economies (1962–1983).","Transfers to households stimulated growth, while public production and firm subsidies often depressed it; military spending also had a positive effect.","Revise social protection policies to prioritize direct household support over firm subsidies to enhance economic growth.","Social protection",NA

In this article, I reexamine income segregation from 1990 to 2010 in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, and I find that income segregation increased only among families with children. Among childless households—two-thirds of the population—income segregation changed little and is half as large as among households with children. I examine two factors that may account for these differences by household composition. First, I find that increasing income inequality, identified by past research as a driver of income segregation, was a much more powerful predictor of income segregation among families with children, among whom income inequality has risen more. Second, I find that local school options, delineated by school district boundaries, contribute to higher segregation among households with children compared to households without.

"11","Collective Labor Rights and Income Inequality","Jasmine Kerrissey",2015,"This article examines the relationship between income inequality and collective labor rights, conceptualized as workers’ legal and practical ability to engage in collective activity. Although worker organization is central to explaining income inequality in industrialized democracies, worldwide comparative studies have neglected the role of class-based actors. I argue that the repression of labor rights reduces the capacity of worker organizations to effectively challenge income inequality through market and political processes in capitalist societies. Labor rights, however, are unlikely to have uniform effects across regions. This study uses unbalanced panel data for 100 developed and less developed countries from 1985 through 2002.

This is an important issue for welfare state theory and research, and this article presents an analysis that builds from analytical innovations developed in the emerging literature on linkages between mass opinion and public policy. The authors analyze a new dataset combining a measure of social policy preferences with data on welfare state spending, alongside controls for established causal factors behind social policy-making. The analysis provides evidence that policy preferences exert a significant influence over welfare state output. Guided also by statistical tests for endogeneity, the authors find that cross-national differences in the level of policy preferences help to account for a portion of the differences among social, Christian, and liberal welfare state regimes. The results have implications for developing fruitful connections between welfare state scholarship, comparative opinion research, and recent opinion/policy studies.","10.1177/000312240607100306","American Sociological Review","Public economics; Public policy; Welfare state; Economics; Social policy; Policy studies; Scholarship; Endogeneity; Statistical hypothesis testing","en",320,"https://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/3/474.abstract",18,"Investigated whether public support for social policies affects welfare state spending using a new cross-national dataset of developed democracies.","Stronger mass preferences for social policy were significantly associated with higher welfare state spending, even after controlling for other drivers.","Incorporate public opinion data into social protection policy design to align welfare efforts with citizen priorities and increase legitimacy.","Social protection",NA

This article revisits Korpi and Palme’s classic, and in the process, explores and informs a set of enduring questions about social policy, politics, and social equality. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between three dimensions of welfare transfers—transfer share (the average share of household income from welfare transfers), low-income targeting, and universalism—and poverty and preferences for redistribution. We analyze rich democracies like Korpi and Palme, but we also generalize to a broader sample of developed and developing countries.

"15","European Integration and Income Inequality","Jason Beckfield",2006,"Globalization has attained a prominent place on the sociological agenda, and stratification scholars have implicated globalization in the increased income inequality observed in many advanced capitalist countries. But sociologists have given much less attention to a different yet increasingly prevalent form of internationalization: regional integration. Regional integration, or the construction of international economy and polity within negotiated regions, should matter for income inequality. Regional economic integration should raise income inequality, as workers are exposed to international competition and labor unions are weakened. Regional political integration should also raise income inequality, but through a different mechanism: political integration should drive welfare state retrenchment in market-oriented regional polities as states adopt liberal policies in a context of fiscal austerity.

Two U.S. surveys (1990 and 1995) find a progressive decline in economic hardship in successively older age groups consistent with the adequacy-gradient hypothesis.

"21","International Human Rights and Domestic Income Inequality A Difficult Case of Compliance in World Society","Wade M. Cole",2015,"Much research finds that human rights treaties fail to improve domestic practices unless governments are held accountable in some fashion. The implication is that noncompliance can be attributed to insincere commitments and willful disobedience. I challenge this claim for a core but overlooked treaty: the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Few analysts have studied the ICESCR because its terms are difficult to implement and suitable measures for judging compliance are hard to find.

We develop this framework with a decomposition of family income inequality using annual data from the March Current Population Survey.

This paper attempts to bridge this gap by drawing out some of the implications of Marx's ownership of the means of production and Dahrendorf s authority for both income inequality and politics, by evaluating these implications empirically and by showing how these conceptions of class can be incorporated into the dominant Blau-Duncan model of status attainment. Using survey data from large national samples in the United States and Great Britain, we show that both Marx's and Dahrendorfs class models have important implications for men's income, increasing by almost half the variance explained by the conventional Blau-Duncan model. The income of American women, in contrast, is little influenced by class and this explains a substantial part of the male-female income gap. As Marx, Dahrendorf, and others predicted, class position has a stronger impact on class identification and politics in Great Britain than in the United States.

The former hypothesis is consistent with approaches to the explanation of collective political violence that emphasize the general concept of discontent or, more specifically, relative deprivation; the latter hypothesis is consistent with a political-process version of the resource mobilization approach. In the context of a multivariate model estimated across two decades, 1958-67 and 1968-77, support is found for the inequality hypothesis. Support also is foundfor the regime repressiveness hypothesis in the decade (1968-77) for which the index of regime repressiveness is available.

In agrarian economies, where labor-intensive family enterprises dominate, political officials' income advantages decline rapidly relative to those of private entrepreneurs. Larger enterprises, however, provide greater income opportunities for officials, especially when a government retains an ownership stake in the initial phases of reform. This article replicates the findings from an earlier study of rural China using comparable survey data from Vietnam. We find that during the first two decades of rural market reform in Vietnam and China, the scale and ownership of firms differed radically.

We argue that social insurance institutions are of central importance for redistributive outcomes. Using new data, our comparative analyses of the effects of different institutional types of welfare states on poverty and inequality indicate that institutional differences lead to unexpected outcomes and generate the paradox of redistribution: The more we target benefits at the poor and the more concerned we are with creating equality via equal public transfers to all, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality. Social scientists and social reformers have long debated how the welfare state and social policies should be designed so as to best reduce poverty and inequality. This debate involves two different issues. One question concerns whether social policies should be targeted or universal, that is, should they be organized for the poor only or should the welfare state include all citizens?

The case of post-Mao China is examined using nationally representative survey data gathered in 1996 to address unresolved questions about findings from 1980s' surveys. Well into reform's second decade, political officeholding has a large net impact on household income-comparable to that of operating a private enterprise. Contrary to findings based on earlier surveys and expectations about the impact of growth, cadre household advantages are stable across levels and forms of economic expansion. Returns to entrepreneurship, however, decline sharply with the spread of wage employment. Future declines in relative returns to political position are therefore unlikely to occur due to the further spread of private household entrepreneurship, and theories of change based on this mechanism appear untenable.","10.2307/3088894","American Sociological Review","Economy; Agrarian society; Economics; Survey data collection; Wage; Inequality; Economic expansion; Economic inequality; Entrepreneurship; Subsistence economy","en; ru",173,"http://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-31453",51,"Used nationally representative 1996 survey data to assess how political officeholding affected income in rural China during market reforms.","Political elites maintained large income advantages despite market expansion, unlike entrepreneurs whose returns diminished with wage work.","Implement governance reforms under income poverty policy to reduce political capture in expanding economies.","Income poverty",NA

The analysis is disaggregated by age and utilizes dimensions of underemployment to provide more sensitive indicators for labor market conditions, including measures of job availability (such as unemployment) and job quality (such as low hours and low wages). Controls are included for criminal opportunity and other variables related to crime and the labor market. Labor market effects on arrest rates differ for juveniles and young adults. Availability of employment produces strong effects on juvenile arrest rates--full-time employment is associated with low arrest rates, unemployment with high arrest rates. Low quality of employment (e.g., inadequate pay and hours) is associated with high arrest rates for young adults. We discuss theoretical and policy implications of our findings.

The major difference between Muller (1988) and Muller (1995) is that he is now more concerned with accounting for changes in democracy, whereas in the earlier paper he sought to explain years of stable democracy. To measure change in political democracy, Muller (1995) uses 1965 and 1980 measures of democracy developed by Bollen (1980, 1993), in lieu of his own earlier ""years of stable democracy"" measure.

A closer reading of Tocqueville, attentive to both his marginal and more central works, reveals good reasons for opposing the reforms that critics of public assistance have proposed in Tocqueville's time and in our own. The historicist view that Tocqueville's social and economic thought was incoherent, backward-looking, and increasingly irrelevant following capitalist industrialization is also criticized. While Tocqueville's theory of democracy requires revision in important respects, its potential has not been exhausted. In fact, a reconstruction of Tocqueville's theory of democracy goes well beyond the discourse of the New Right, pointing instead to the possibility of reforming the welfare state in a creative and innovative way through social policies that are enabling rather than tutelary, universalistic rather than targeted, preventive rather than compensatory, and associative rather than atomizing.","10.2307/2657419","American Sociological Review","Welfare state; Sociology; Law and economics; Law; New Right; Social citizenship; Public assistance; Historicism; Industrialisation; Reading (process); Democracy","en",35,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657419?origin=crossref",65,"Re-examined Tocqueville’s theory of democracy to challenge its misuse in contemporary welfare debates and reconstruct its social policy relevance.","A full reading of Tocqueville supports universalistic, enabling, and preventive welfare policies over punitive approaches.","Reframe welfare state reforms under social protection policy toward inclusive, participatory, and universal approaches.","Social protection",NA

Random-effects regression models that control for unmeasured country heterogeneity are used to investigate effects of foreign capital penetration on inequality (measured as the Gini coefficient) against the background of an internal-developmental model of inequality. We adapt Firebaugh's (1992, 1996) critique of the literature on the effect of foreign investment on economic growth to the study of income inequality and find that the stock of foreign direct investment has an effect on inequality that is independent of the mechanisms identified by Firebaugh. We explore Tsai's (1995) claim that the effect of foreign capital penetration is spurious and find that foreign stock has a significant positive effect on inequality net of region-specific differences. An alternative interpretation of the findings of the foreign investment/inequality literature is discussed in light of the discovery of an inverted-U shaped relationship between income inequality and foreign investment stock per capita.

Robinson",1989,"Recent studies of collective political violence have overlooked international causal factors. This cross-national study of 46-51 nations (including analyses of influential cases) expends on earlier analyses by simultaneously examining both the ""external"" (international) and the ""internal"" (intranational) determinants of collective political violence. Regression analysis suggests that transnational corporate penetration, an international factor, contributes to increased political violence both directly and indirectly, through its effect on income inequality.

"45","Economic hardship declines with age","John Mirowsky; Catherine E. Ross",1999,"Economic hardship declines with age among U.S. adults. The association is substantial, real, and worth acknowledging. Advocates for the welfare of senior Americans might find the fact awkward; Hardy and Hazelrigg (1999, henceforward HH those operating as advocates for the elderly will serve better by doing this as well. Reluctance to accept the fact flows from the false assumption that policy can redistribute economic hardship but not diminish it. The political and moral dilemmas of redistribution suggest the opposite-by understanding why older Americans experience less economic hardship than younger adults, we may find ways to reduce economic hardship for Americans of all ages. The remainder of this reply addresses the issues H&H raise directly or implicitly. We argue that the negative correlation between age and economic hardship is substantial, and is neither artifact nor illusion. Squeezing, stretching, cutting, or disassembling the economic hardship index will not change this basic result. Following persons as they age rather than comparing persons of different ages will not change it. Adjusting for mediators may reduce the association, but that should come as no surprise. Adjusting for income increases it, because seniors have low income but also low economic hardship. Spurning age's effect net of income as false consciousness reveals much about the observer but nothing about the observed. In the end, there is and will be no reason to disbelieve that economic hardship declines with age.","10.2307/2657257","American Sociological Review","Welfare; False consciousness; Economics; Surprise; Economic hardship; Negative correlation; Younger adults; Low income; Demographic economics; Politics","en",8,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657257",75,"Reanalyzed U.S. survey data to explore age-related trends in economic hardship and policy implications.","Economic hardship declined substantially with age, even after controlling for income and mediators.","Target social protection policies toward younger adults to reduce hardship where it is most concentrated.","Social protection",NA
"46","Class and Income Inequality in Korea","Hagen Koo; Doo-Seung Hong",1980,"This paper seeks to contribute to recent efforts to improve status attainment models by introducing class categories or labor market segmentation. The research reported here replicates and extends Wright and Perrone's (1977) analysis of class categories and income inequality in the United States in the context of a rapidly industrializing society. The results confirm that Marxist class categories are as consequential as occupational status in explaining income inequality in both advanced and developing capitalist societies. Yet, there are several difficulties in applying this class model to developing economies, so that a substantially modified class model is developed taking the manual-nonmanual distinction and structural marginality as additional major axes of class determination. This new model is superior to Wright's (1976) model in explaining income inequality in Korea. In the final part of the paper, a tentative test of a dependency model of inequality is attempted, with negative results for the predicted hypothesis of the center-periphery sectoral inequality.","10.2307/2095011","American Sociological Review","Income inequality metrics; Economics; Labor market segmentation; Wright; Context (language use); Demographic economics; Status attainment; Inequality; Economic growth; Economic inequality; Income distribution","en",28,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2095011.pdf",79,"Tested class-based models of inequality using Korean labor market data to improve status attainment theories.","Modified Marxist models explained inequality in Korea more effectively than occupational status alone.","Integrate class segmentation models under income poverty policy to address stratification in developing economies.","Income poverty",NA
"47","Changing Income Inequalities within and between Nations: New Evidence","Brian Goesling",2001,"Fresh data sources on cross-national income are examined to document recent changes in the composition of world income inequality within and between nations. New evidence shows that during the 1980s and 1990s the composition of world income inequality experienced a fundamental change, characterized by the diminishing significance of between-nation income differences and the growing prominence of within-nation inequalities. Two competing trends account for this change: (1) steady growth in the average level of income inequality within nations, and (2) a decline in income inequality between nations. These recent trends signify a reversal in one of the major legacies of the Industrial Revolution-the internationalization of world income inequality across national borders.

Such a study provides a window on global trends in social inequality during the period, which spans the tail end of the Kuznets curve and the more recent upswing in income inequality. Results from random-effects regression models that control for unmeasured heterogeneity among states reveal the continued importance of the Kuznetsian pattern of declining inequality with economic development, a positive effect of urbanization on inequality, a declining positive impact of sector dualism, an increasing positive effect of educational heterogeneity, and a persistent effect of racial dualism. Several variables associated with the recent upswing in inequality have significant effects : female labor-force participation (negative), female-headed households (positive), percent of the population over age 65 (changes from positive to negative over the period), manufacturing employment (negative), and unemployment (ambiguous).

"49","ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF DEMOCRACY","Edward N. Muller",1995,"The relationship between the level of economic development and the level of democracy found in most quantitative cross-national research implies that the largest gains in democracy are experienced by countries at intermediate levels of development. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, middle-income countries were more likely to register declines in democracy than increases. I explain this anomaly with the hypothesis that income inequality affects democracy, and this effect often counteracts the positive influence of economic development. Because intermediate levels of economic development are associated with the highest levels of income inequality, the independent negative effect of income inequality on change in level of democracy explains the declines in democracy in middle-income countries. Cross-national data from a sample of 58 countries support the hypothesis of a negative effect of income inequality on change in level of democracy from 1965 to 1980.

The analyses also show that negative effects of unemployment on workers' subsequent earnings are mitigated through either generous unemployment benefit systems or strict labor market regulation.

Even after taking selection and social desirability processes into account, all types of exposure are found to affect public attitudes in the predicted (favorable) direction.

However, we have a gap in our knowledge when it comes to the similar consequences of temporary employment. This is problematic, because although temporary jobs are often considered better alternatives to unemployment for endowing individuals with income and opportunities to connect to employers, they are also associated with stressors such as high levels of job insecurity and poor quality work, the effects of which might spill over to spouses. Using matched data from the British Household Panel Study, I show that temporary work is at least as detrimental as unemployment for spouses’ subjective well-being, although there are differences.

Some nations have cut spending; others have reorganized priorities to provide support for dual-earner families, single mothers, or elderly people who need long-term care. The United States appears instead to be in transition from a social insurance welfare state to a ""capital investment welfare state "" in which the objective is to increase savings and investment. This shift in U.S. public policy is most explicit in the ascendance of a neoconservative ideology, which depicts the welfare state as an impediment to a free market. This ideology has lent credence to proposals for privatizing Social Security and is implicit in seemingly minor technocratic changes in Medicare, which nonetheless have inserted market principles into a social insurance program. Whether current trends represent the most recent manifestation of American exceptionalism or a concurrent restructuring across nations can be determined only by comparative research examining (1) how different nations are responding to contemporary fiscal pressures, and (2) if nations are redistributing the social welfare burden from the public to the private sector.","10.2307/2657274","American Sociological Review","Private sector; Welfare state; Economy; Political economy; Political science; Free market; Globalization; American exceptionalism; Social insurance; Single mothers; Social Welfare","en",73,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657274?origin=crossref",112,"Explored the ideological and policy shift in the U.S. toward a capital investment welfare state prioritizing market efficiency.","Privatization and market reforms in programs like Social Security signaled a departure from traditional social insurance principles.","Safeguard public welfare infrastructure under social protection policy to prevent over-reliance on market-based models.","Social protection",NA

The impact of corporatism across 16 affluent OECD countries in the 1980s and 1990s is assessed using pooled time-series cross-section analysis. The results suggest that wage coordination was conducive to low unemployment in the 1980s because it fostered moderation in labor costs, spurred faster economic growth, and encouraged governments to more aggressively pursue policies to reduce unemployment. In the 1990s, this effect disappeared, largely because unemployment outcomes in low wage-coordination countries improved rather than because unemployment outcomes in high wage-coordination countries deteriorated.

Log-linear and log-multiplicative models are used to compare mobility regimes and to estimate effects of industrialization, educational enrollment, social democracy, and income inequality on immobility and other parameters of the mobility process. Several models of mobility fit the data equally well, so criteria of plausibility and parsimony are applied to choose one model of stratum-specific immobility and another model of vertical mobility with uniform immobility. We find substantial similarity in mobility and immobility across countries, but the exogenous variables do explain systematic differences among countries. Cross-national variations are complex because most of the exogenous variables have different effects on different parameters of the mobility regime.

Silva",1998,"The authors investigate the childhood and adolescent predictors of youth unemployment in a longitudinal study of young adults who have been studied for the 21 years since their births in 1972-1973. They test hypotheses about the predictors of youth unemployment using information about each individual's human capital, social capital, and personal capital. In the human capital domain, lack of high-school qualifications, poor reading skills, low IQ scores, and limited parental resources significantly increased the risk of unemployment. In the social capital domain, growing up in a single-parent family, family conflict, and lack of attachment to school also increased the risk of unemployment. In the personal capital domain, children involved in antisocial behavior had an increased risk of unemployment. These predictors of unemployment reached back to early childhood, suggesting that they began to shape labor-market outcomes years before these youths entered the work force. In addition, these effects remained significant after controlling for the duration of education and educational attainment, suggesting that many early personal and family characteristics affect labor-market outcomes, not only because they restrict the accumulation of human capital (e.g., education), but also because they directly affect labor-market behaviors.

Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased.

Pescosolido",2024,"<jats:p> Despite long-standing evidence linking higher unemployment rates to increased suicide rates, a puzzling trend emerged in the United States after the Great Recession: suicide rates continued to rise even as unemployment rates declined. Drawing on theories of social networks and reference groups, we advance the concept of “sameness”—in this case, the extent to which an individual’s employment status aligns with the fate of others in one’s community—to clarify how unemployment rates influence suicide. Constructing a multilevel dataset of U.S. suicide deaths from 2005 to 2017, we find that while unemployed individuals face a higher risk of suicide compared to the employed, this gap diminishes in communities with high local unemployment rates. Moreover, the “sameness” effect extends beyond geographic contexts to temporal ones, as national unemployment spikes reduce suicide risk among the unemployed and diminish the importance of local sameness. Together, these findings suggest a mechanism of “situational awareness,” whereby local and national economic contexts shape the meaning of unemployment, shifting its interpretation from personal failure to system failure and reducing its stigma. Our article offers a novel framework for examining the effects of cross-level interactions in suicide research, highlighting the crucial role of culture as deeply intertwined with social network mechanisms in shaping contextual influence. </jats:p>","10.1177/00031224241288179","American Sociological Review","Unemployment; Link (geometry); Psychology; Sociology; Demographic economics; Criminology; Economics; Economic growth; Computer science; Computer network","en",0,"https://osf.io/nr6dz/download",173,"Used U.S. suicide data (2005–2017) to assess how local and national unemployment rates shape suicide risk.","Unemployed individuals had higher suicide risk, but this effect was buffered in communities with high unemployment.","Design employment and mental health policies that recognize contextual factors shaping stigma and vulnerability.","Employment",NA

It uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test three accounts regarding how wars affect men’s lives.

The moderated cumulative disadvantage account suggests that combat most negatively affects those who, before they fought, had lower status.

This study (1) constructs detailed geographic measures of changes in employment opportunities, (2) estimates a fixed-effects model of changes in the unemployment rate over time, and (3) accounts for spatial correlation in the error term. Neighborhood-level employment data from 1980 and 1990 are used to measure changes in the distance to jobs from census tracts in the Detroit and Chicago metropolitan areas. In both cities, the decentralization of employment and the loss of manufacturing jobs resulted in substantial changes in the spatial distribution of employment.

We then find that the unconditional cash transfer increased the resilience index by 12 points, or 30 per cent over the baseline mean index value.

The results show that trade openness increases a country's exposure to external shocks. This enforces the negative impact on budget balances of terms of trade instability. Additionally, trade openness influences budget balances through several other channels: corruption, income inequalities, etc. Then natural openness and trade policy have opposite effects: the former deteriorates budget balances whereas the latter enhances them.","10.1080/00220380600930762","The Journal of Development Studies","Commercial policy; Economics; International economics; Corruption; Terms of trade; Econometric analysis; Western hemisphere; Inequality; Developing country; Openness to experience","en",82,"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00023333",2684,"Examined effects of trade openness on budget balances in 66 developing countries (1974–1998) using GMM estimators.","Natural openness worsens budget balances via exposure to shocks, while trade policy improves them through institutional channels.","Adjust income poverty policy by pairing openness with stabilization tools to protect vulnerable economies from fiscal shocks.","Income poverty","JEL Classification Numbers: H62; F02; F13 Trade openness; Trade policy; Natural openness; Budget balances; Terms of trade instability; Developing countries; GMM-system"

To study the impact of migration requires a prior understanding of the processes determining income distribution, so the main theories of the latter are briefly surveyed, including subsistence, neoclassical, institutional, and structural models. In each case the main theme is labour market functioning. The impact of migration in each of these models is then discussed, partly in terms of the properties of the models themselves, partly in terms of plausible migration scenarios. The empirical literature is briefly surveyed, covering characteristics of migrants; integration of migrants in destination areas; urban-rural interactions in terms of remittances, terms of trade, and return-migration; and macro-economic issues.

Whereas the vast income disparity between urban and rural households is confirmed, it is found that, remarkably, rural households report higher subjective well-being than do their richer urban counterparts. A decomposition analysis explores the reasons for this reversal. It finds that there are many determinants of happiness other than absolute income, and that the determinants differ in the two sectors. An explanation for the puzzle is advanced in terms of relative concepts, income inequalities, orbits of comparison, and degrees of insecurity.

Peasant incomes have increased dramatically since the post‐Mao reforms. Rural areas have new power, but this is a consequence not a cause of the reforms. The improvement in rural conditions reflects a change in the central state's development strategy and ideology, and the local response to incentives embedded in China's reforms. The impetus for these changes is self‐preservation of the state and the Chinese Communist Party.

And, secondly, do such considerations necessitate more holistic and context-specific policies or strategies in synchronising social cohesion initiatives with youth development policies? The paper’s preliminary hypothesis is that there is a strong correlation between high levels of youth unemployment and low levels of social cohesion in South Africa and that improvements in the level of cohesiveness require high levels of inclusiveness within the socioeconomic structures of a country, notably in the economy. The secondary hypothesis is that for South Africa to achieve sustained social inclusion, it is imperative that holistic and context-specific strategies are implemented.

The main conclusion is that national income accounting heightened planners' awareness of income inequality between Sudan and other states, but lessened their awareness of regional inequality within Sudan.

In all, 141 revellers were contacted through questionnaire administration within a 3-day period during the programme. Indepth Interview (IDI) schedules were also conducted with key stakeholders who were incharge of organising the waiver programmes. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS while qualitative data were manually transcribed. The study revealed that low income earners took advantage of the waiver programmes (attested by 44% of respondents) with p-value of 0.034 to make use of the park. Similarly, about 70% of respondents consideredinability to afford the cost of entry tickets a factor which hindered their recreational use of the park. The fee waiver concept was noted in the study as well-intended and a strategic recommendation suggested by park-goers signaled the need for boosting recreational activities in the park to engage visitors all day long for a richer experience.

Recent work posits a relationship between landholding and the prevalence of malnutrition. This question is re‐phrased here by introducing household developmental cycles into the argument, supported by new data. In the context of the class of land‐ and employment‐poor rural households in the North‐east, these cycles operate to produce a high‐risk phase of development through which all households have to pass as they mature. The prevalence of malnutrition is then explained by specific household characteristics which in turn dictate the effectiveness of the subsistence strategies employed, where income is collected together from agriculture and/or wage labour.

The government’s function has always been to create a favourable environment for business for all SMEs to thrive better. Due to such difficulties encountered by the citizenry, despite existing empowerment policies, the government introduced the Constituency Development Fund to support SMEs within their cooperatives in Zambia; this is to reduce the barriers that obstruct SMEs’ profile opportunities to grow and to be sustainable to fulfil government and society expectations. The drive of this study was to analyze thematically different profile opportunities of SMEs in the manner in which they can access CDF. The study focused on opportunities that lie in each SME’s profile and identified the profiles according to their needs. The method which was used in this study was qualitative and employed purposive sampling to comprehend SMEs’ profile opportunities. The results of this study resolved that SMEs’ profile needs to be helped to core exists as they utilize or struggle to access funding from the existing CDF. The emergent themes reported in this study show that there are significant qualitative profiles to consider as officers in charge of CDF disburse the funds to the beneficiaries. In conclusion, the study recommended policymakers support small businesses to grow in an inclusive, innovative and sustainable way in line with the financial opportunities available.

These studies focused on macro analysis of programmes’ outcomes but paid little attention to an indepth micro study of the everyday intersubjective accounts and actions of local community focal persons and caregivers, which construct programme outcomes. The objective of this study is to highlight the everyday concrete outcomes of a cash transfer programme in Ejisu-Juaben Municipality in Ghana. This study draws on Foucault’s notion of subjectivation and discourse to construct a conversation and membership categorisation analyses framework to explore community focal persons’ and female caregivers’ conversations from focus group discussions. The Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty cash transfer programme in Ghana is the empirical case. This article demonstrates that caregivers and poor households arehappier, practice joint decision-making, and have cohesive social relations in poor households. Thus, localised programme outcomes improved participation in the decision-making, happiness, and social cohesion of beneficiary poor households. Evaluation mechanisms for programme outcomes could consider the everyday intersubjective accounts, practices of focal persons, caregivers/beneficiaries in poor households at the micro-level.

Empirical Evidence from a Small Island Developing Country","Mahendra Reddy",2024,"<jats:p>Food security remains one of the main goals for all countries worldwide. While several agencies have mobilized resources to achieve this goal, food insecurity remains a significant livelihood challenge in many developing countries. Therefore, in this paper, we examine some critical factors affecting the food security of rural agricultural households in Fiji using the latest Agricultural Census data. This study reveals that farmers’ access to fishing grounds and non-timber forest resources can improve farming households’ food security. The study also shows that while the government vigorously pursues a transition from subsistence agriculture towards commercial agriculture, improving market access and reducing transportation costs will significantly improve food security. Given the importance of regular cash income, the study also demonstrates that off-farm employment of household members, particularly larger-sized households, will substantially help to improve food security. Lastly, and most importantly, the government must quickly examine how it could mitigate challenges posed by climate change, as this could devastate food security via reduced food production.</jats:p>","10.24018/ejdevelop.2024.4.1.335","European Journal of Development Studies","Food security; Climate change; Empirical evidence; Developing country; Business; Natural resource economics; Development economics; Geography; Economics; Economic growth; Ecology; Agriculture; Philosophy; Archaeology; Epistemology; Biology","en",2,"https://ej-develop.org/index.php/ejdevelop/article/download/335/202",2745,"Used census data to study food security in Fiji’s rural households amid climate change threats.","Access to marine and forest resources, off-farm income, and market connectivity are key to food security.","Bolster climate and food insecurity policy by integrating resource access and employment into food resilience plans.","Climate vulnerability; Food insecurity",NA

Evidence from Four Latin American Countries","Rodrigo Gorga; Martín Leites; Andrea Vigorito",2024,"Increased conspicuous consumption motivated by status-seeking behavior can undermine the gains in well-being derived from economic growth. Using expenditure surveys from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay, we assess visible consumption motivated by status seeking behaviour, analyzing different hypotheses about the role of externalities driven by social comparisons and income inequality. Specifically, we provide evidence for the relevance of different reference groups, assessing comparisons with richer (Veblen effects), poorer and similar profile groups (Duesenberry effects). We show that individuals are affected by multiple reference groups. Regarding between-group inequality, we find that individuals mainly seek to differentiate themselves from poorer groups, rather than imitating richer ones. In all cases, average reference group income of similar profile individuals is negatively related to visible consumption. Meanwhile, within-reference group responses are relevant in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico: increased visible goods consumption is associated with larger relative income gaps. In Argentina and Brazil, the sensitivity of visible goods expenditures to income is higher among households located above the reference threshold, which is consistent, again, with more affluent households trying to signal status by differentiating themselves from the most deprived group members. Meanwhile, in the case of Mexico, there is a symmetric response.","10.1080/00220388.2024.2314120","The Journal of Development Studies","Inequality; Consumption (sociology); Latin Americans; Veblen good; Economics; Demographic economics; Externality; Economic inequality; Conspicuous consumption; Social comparison theory; Welfare economics; Development economics; Psychology; Social psychology; Sociology; Political science; Emerging markets; Microeconomics; Macroeconomics; Mathematical analysis; Social science; Mathematics; Law","en",1,"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Visible_Consumption_Income_Inequality_and_Social_Comparisons_Evidence_from_Four_Latin_American_Countries/25287576/1/files/44686065.pdf",2758,"Analyzed household expenditure data from four Latin American countries to understand visible consumption patterns driven by social comparisons.","Status-seeking behaviors vary by reference group, with affluent households spending more to differentiate from poorer peers, especially in Argentina and Brazil.","Revise income poverty policy to address consumption inequality and promote inclusive well-being metrics beyond income.","Income poverty",NA

The article provides unique insight into what characterises informal workers, and the circumstances under which associations may ensure social protection for their members. The analysis shows that members of informal worker associations are significantly more likely to participate in formal insurance schemes compared with non-members, albeit with some variation across location, sector, and worker types. These divergences relate partly to sector-specific and institutional constellations, as well as the ways in which informal worker associations function. Moreover, the article shows that informal worker associations often play a dual role by providing both direct short-term social cushioning and enabling enrolment in formal social insurance schemes.

These statistics suggest that educated unemployment is largely a problem of waiting or a lag in absorbtion in the labour market. Thus we concentrated on explaining the causes of waiting. To do so, we organised the information from survey data (including a sample of 2, 671 employed and 260 unemployed) we had at hand into factors indicating market realism and market strength (both competitive and noncompetitive). The unemployed themselves perceived “contacts” as an important factor affecting their success on the job market. While this feeling cannot be ignored, we found that the job and wage expectations of the educated unemployed were unrealistic and that their motivations for pursuing higher education were not career oriented.

The approach draws on the standard economic concept of risk aversion, and it is based on the intuition that households will prefer a steady stream of income to a variable one with the same mean. Relying on a Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility function, we use panel data for Argentina to compute risk-adjusted income and poverty measures. At the aggregate level, we find that taking risk into account substantially increases the poverty headcount. Moreover, a regression analysis suggests that many household characteristics are correlated not only with the average income of the household over time, but also with its variability.","10.1080/00220380701526329","The Journal of Development Studies","Economics; Poverty; Econometrics; Intuition; Panel data; Risk aversion (psychology); Household income; Demographic economics; Expected utility hypothesis; Financial economics; Geography; Economic growth; Philosophy; Archaeology; Epistemology","en",9,"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/6550/1/Risk-Adjusted_Poverty_in_Argentina_Measurement_and_Determinants.pdf",2806,"Developed a risk-adjusted income poverty metric using panel data and utility functions in Argentina.","Accounting for income volatility raises the measured poverty rate and reveals new household-level vulnerabilities.","Refine intersectional poverty measurement by integrating income volatility into national poverty estimates.","Intersectional poverty","Risk; Poverty; Argentina JEL Codes: D81; I32; D63"

Although some non-linearities emerge in asset dynamics, there is convergence towards one stable equilibrium for the whole sample that suggests the existence of a structural poverty trap. However, households are quite heterogeneous: when analysing refugees and hosts separately, refugees converge to a lower own-group equilibrium than hosts. The household size and education are asset growth enablers for both communities. Noticeably, access to land, past history and social cohesion are also significant correlates of refugees' asset dynamics. From a policy perspective, structural poverty traps are bad news, because standard anti-poverty interventions would not unlock the trap.

One important finding of our analysis (using data for Albania) is that reconciling subjective and objective poverty profiles suggests the presence of sizable economies of scale. This result calls for increased attention to the proper estimation of a scale parameter for poverty analysis, as changes in assumptions on economies of size and adult equivalence scales are likely to produce significant changes in the analysis of poverty and its distribution across households and individuals.","10.1080/00220380600741896","The Journal of Development Studies","Welfare; Feeling; Economics; Equivalence (measure theory); Poverty; Economies of scale; Poverty measurement; Distribution (economics); Demographic economics; Welfare economics; Estimation","en",42,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220380600741896",2817,"Assessed differences between objective and subjective welfare measures in Albania using household survey data.","Subjective poverty perceptions diverged from objective measures due to assumptions about household scale and equivalence.","Revise social protection targeting by integrating subjective welfare insights to capture hidden vulnerability and resource needs.","Social protection",NA

Inequality rose despite a rapid increase in the share of educated workers in the labour market that might have been expected to depress returns to education. Returns to a college education rose in Taiwan for all but the least experienced college graduates who were the most substitutable by the large new cohorts of college graduates. This pattern of changes in relative employment and relative wages is consistent with persistent shifts in relative demand toward skilled labour. The shifts are not sector-specific as might have been the case if shifts in trade flows were responsible for the shifts in relative wages. Growth of relative employment of more-educated workers occurred in all sectors of the economy, consistent with the hypothesis of skill-biased technical change.

All the institutions studied had, on balance, positive impacts on income and asset levels, with income impacts correlating negatively with income on account of poor households choosing to invest in low-risk, low-return assets.

Impact of Weather Shocks on Nutrition in Malawi","Shannon Marie McLaughlin; Martina Bozzola; Anne Nugent",2023,"In this study, we capture the impact of changing temperature and rainfall patterns on the estimated consumption of macro-and micronutrients among households in Malawi. We apply a fixed-effects model to household panel data collected between 2010 and 2017, which contains detailed information on food consumption, combined with rainfall and temperature data over the past 30 years. In turn, we aim to identify the impact of weather shocks on household food and nutrition security. We find decreases in rainfall from the long-term average results in declining daily consumption of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat), and micronutrients (iron, zinc, vitamin C, and B2). Increases in temperature from the long-term average are associated with reduced daily consumption of carbohydrates, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin A, B2, folate, and B12. These results suggest that reduced rainfall and higher temperatures will exacerbate food insecurity in Malawi. As the effects of climate change are becoming more apparent, enhancing our understanding of the effect of weather shocks on nutrition in developing countries will be vital to aid policymakers to implement targeted interventions to advance food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Data for the study were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. It was found that mortgage financing in the country had not contributed significantly to poverty alleviation in the past five and a half decades due to factors, such as the poor capital base of the mortgage finance institutions resulting in inadequate loanable funds, difficulty in accessing available loanable funds by the low and middle income groups, high interest rates on available loanable funds which are unaffordable to the low and middle income groups, challenges of the Land Use Act of 1978 and the inconsistent financial policies of the Nigerian financial system. The paper concludes that the mortgage market in the country could be strengthened to act as an instrument for poverty alleviation and economic empowerment. It recommends the introduction of pro-poor mortgage facilities in the mortgage industry in Nigeria as such initiatives will economically empower the low and middle income groups in the country to invest in real estate through home ownership and thereby contribute to the alleviation of poverty.

"148","Is Product Diversification the Ultimate Quid Pro Quo for Gender sensitive Poverty Alleviation? Adverse Social Externalities from Combined Microfinance in Latin America and the Caribbean","Koen Rossel-Cambier",2013,"Documented deficiencies in traditional social transfer mechanisms have led to the emergence of alternative methods for reducing poverty. While microcredit programmes have undoubtedly improved the lives of millions of poor households, they are also criticised for not being inclusive enough to reach out to the poor and their specific needs. This paper explores if product diversification has an effect on poverty outreach, in particular when combining micro-credit with savings and insurance. By reviewing cross-sectional evidence of 250 microfinance schemes in Latin America and the Caribbean, one can find positive effects of combined microfinance (CMF) on the breadth of outreach. Still, the contribution of CMF on the depth of poverty outreach is less evident, both viewed from an income-related and gender-sensitive lens. The findings suggest that the presence of savings is accompanied with a relatively lower participation of poor and female clients.

However, we find high variability in consumption and poverty, over the seasons and year‐by‐year. Econometric analysis suggests that consumption is affected by idiosyncratic and common shocks, including rainfall and household‐specific crop failure, while households respond to seasonal incentives related to changing labour demand and prices.

Studies done in the country are silent about the effect of aid on poverty reduction and sustainable development. The study fills this missing link in the literature.

Few have felt neutral or considered the possibility that its effects might depend on the country concerned or the type of tourist development to be undertaken.

The methodology consists of a macro–micro simulation in which a CGE model provides labour market outcomes, which in turn are used to manipulate the sectoral allocation of employment to generate the income distribution consistent with the new labour market outcome. In the application to Jamaica, we find that the reallocation of resources away from rent-seeking activities in the presence of exchange controls is significant and has large macroeconomic effects. Opening up of the current account has little effect on poverty, but liberalisation of the capital account reduces poverty, especially amongst the very poor. Neither policy change taken separately, nor the combination of the two, has more than a negligible effect on the distribution of income.","10.1080/00220380412331322841","Journal of Development Studies","Welfare; Balance of payments; Macroeconomics; Labour economics; Economics; Poverty; Capital account; Distribution (economics); Income distribution; Current account; Rent-seeking","en",19,"http://www.unc.edu/~shanda/research/micro_macro_jds_2003.pdf",2852,"Simulated macro-micro impacts of balance of payments reforms in Jamaica using CGE and labor market models.","Capital account liberalization reduced poverty modestly, but distributional effects were minimal.","Calibrate social protection to ensure that macroeconomic reforms generate inclusive benefits for the poorest households.","Social protection",NA

However, the analysis of unemployment insurance (UI) in developing economies with large informal sectors is in its infancy, with few papers providing solid empirical evidence. This paper therefore makes several contributions: first, it applies Chetty's 2008 landmark work on UI to a transition economy (Chile) and shows that the moral hazard effects expected by policy makers, who designed the system are minimal, while liquidity effects were entirely neglected. Second, it demonstrates that it is not enough merely to quantify effects such as moral hazard, but to understand their causes as unemployment generated by moral hazard or liquidity constraints has different welfare implications and should therefore result in different policies. By means of an RDD, this paper analyses the Chilean UI system using a large sample of administrative data, which allows for an extremely precise analysis of how the system works, thus providing invaluable empirical lessons for other countries.","10.1080/00220388.2022.2096444","The Journal of Development Studies","Unemployment; Moral hazard; Economics; Market liquidity; Developing country; Work (physics); Welfare; Hazard; Sample (material); Empirical evidence; Macroeconomics; Economic growth; Incentive; Microeconomics; Market economy; Mechanical engineering; Philosophy; Chemistry; Organic chemistry; Epistemology; Chromatography; Engineering","en",5,"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4421925a-533f-4cf5-9243-09967f1ebf88/files/rd217qq21d",2885,"Used regression discontinuity on Chilean administrative data to assess whether unemployment insurance creates moral hazard or alleviates liquidity constraints.","Liquidity effects were significant while moral hazard was minimal, suggesting the system was miscalibrated to actual behavioral responses.","Revise employment policy by designing unemployment insurance systems in developing countries to prioritize liquidity support over moral hazard deterrence.","Employment",NA

We also introduce the papers in this collection and explain their relationship to the quest for cross-disciplinary research on poverty issues.

These consequences may be different across demographic groups particularly for female workers. We examine whether the policy that restricted operations in some economic sectors affected formal employment for Ecuadorian female workers differently. We use a difference-in-differences-in-differences model to compare female employees working in restricted economic sectors with other workers, before and after the lockdown policy. The results show that the number of unemployment spells rose by approximately 15 per cent for women working in the restricted economic activities. We also document a decrease in the probability of being employed, which is particularly strong for the youngest women (15–24 years-old), oldest women (45–65 years-old), and less educated female workers.

These policies include the School Feeding Programme, Capitation Grant and recently the provision of Free School Uniform to pupils in basic schools. This paper examines household factors as well as contextual factors that militate against the effort of government in achieving quality and gender equality in enrolment and attendance in basic schools in the the Northern Region of Ghana. Household questionnaire, interview guides were used to obtain the primary data while the secondary data were sourced via the internet, published dissertations and journals. Socio-economic factors such as the high cost associated with girls’ education, availability of household resources, poverty and high number of market days served as barriers to gender equality in basic education in the Northern Region of Ghana. Socio-cultural practices such as boy child preference, polygyny, fostering, early marriage, menstruation and attendance at festival celebrations are key factors militating against quality and gender equality in basic schools in the region. Vigorous sensitization on the negative effects of these socio-cultural factors by the government and NGOs and the removal of all forms of levies in basic schools as well as strict enforcement of the Free Compulsory Basic Education policy by the government would go a long way to improve access to basic education in the Northern Region of Ghana.","10.4314/gjds.v12i1-2.8","Ghana Journal of Development Studies","Government; Political science; Poverty; Capitation; Attendance; Basic education; Quality (business); Enforcement; Preference; Economic growth","en",9,"http://udsspace.uds.edu.gh:80/handle/123456789/531",3303,"Used a difference-in-differences approach to assess the impact of Colombia’s Familias en Acción cash transfer program on combatant demobilization during 2001–2004.","The program significantly increased the demobilization of combatants, with effects observed up to three years after implementation.","Strengthen social protection strategies that combine income support with conflict resolution to reduce armed group participation.","Gender and poverty","Equality; Basic Education; Gender; Enrolment; Attendance"

In the past, some scholars were of the view that the language and cultural communities created by migration pose a threat, and others argued that they are advantageous. This article presents a single-factor analytical approach to issues, which suggests that co-existing modalities should be worked out for the host citizens to accept the migrants without reservations. This acceptance is imperative as its negation results in some contexts to the flaring of ugly xenophobic manifestations. The argument presented in this article is pertinent to African languages and education, the African Union, the United Nations, civic, humanitarian organisations, respective governments, interested stakeholders and language communities, amongst others. It provides insight on how to manage cultures and morals among migrants of diverse categories. The article used a mixed research methodology. It reviews ideas on migration globally and in Africa in particular, analysing how migration contributes towards emerging language and cultural societies or communities. A sample of 100 respondents was used for this study. The paper suggests that there should be unity, deregulation and liberalisation of movement of people across the continent for trade and skills-sharing to improve sustainability. The article intends to guide African leaders to co-exist and to encourage fair competition for continental expansion, poverty alleviation and development of positive international language policies.

In order to trace out the political inequality of Dalit and to generalize the findings, both primary and secondary qualitative data have been interpreted and analyzed. The key informant interview method was employed to explore the experiences of Dalit on the current province government political inequality, identity debates, and representation. Furthermore, the review emphasizes the base of inequality in political representative and development process is the mindset of the political leader and more focus on the number of votes rather than the true implementation of the constitutional provision for inclusion.

The post-development paradigm sees all modern concept of development has been failed. Nepal cannot be exceptional from it, as it is struggling towards modernization and development, although some human development indexes seem to be improved. However, the discourse on development has frequently been questioned in Nepal due to its slow pace. Meanwhile, East Asia or China, Asia-Pacific countries changed such assumptions making huge economic progress. Therefore, it will be wrong to blame that the development has completely been failed. It is true that the globalization and advancement in technology have also created complexities worldwide and traditional approach of development may not work effectively because many new social, economic and environmental issues and problems have been raised over decades. The proper approach must consider the existing global context for sustainability and humanity, but not only domination of elites. Presently, good governance and people-centric issues have become a crucial part for the development.

This weighting scheme has been under strong scrutiny since the MPI's inception, given the sensitivity of country rankings to different weights and indicator choices. Therefore, the current study employs Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) for weighting of the indicators and investigates its impact on the scores and relative ranking of 28 countries. The results show that equal weighting of the three dimensions cannot be statistically justified. Moreover, the statistical weights differ systematically across countries, implying differences in deprivations across regions, although household poverty rankings are highly correlated between normative and statistical weights. Given the high correlation between all indicators employed within the MPI, a large overlap is found in the information, implying that there might not actually be so much multidimensionality within the dimensions of the MPI.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.01.013","World Development","Correlation; Econometrics; Weighting; Poverty; Ranking; Multidimensional Poverty Index; Multidimensional poverty; Mathematics; Normative; Multiple correspondence analysis","en",59,"https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:94:y:2017:i:c:p:268-285",3321,"Used panel data to analyze the effect of cash transfers on labor market outcomes in South Africa.","Cash transfers did not reduce labor participation and sometimes increased job-seeking behavior.","Defend and expand social protection schemes by demonstrating they complement rather than deter employment.","Income poverty",NA

Low-wage individuals may be adversely affected by minimum wages, however, although the empirical evidence on this point is not without controversy. We analyzed the effects of the January 2012 increase in monthly minimum wages on the wages and hours worked of low-wage workers in Ecuador. Individuals could have chosen to enter occupations covered by minimum-wage legislation or those that were not. We applied a difference-in-differences estimation to account for potential self-selection bias. We also relied on exogenous variations in minimum wages by sector, industry, and occupation. We constructed individual panel data from a household panel and performed estimates that also accounted for potential sample-selection bias. The results suggest a significant and positive effect on the wages of treated workers, increasing them by 0.41–0.48% for each 1% increase in minimum wages, relative to the earnings of control workers. Our results also suggest that effects varied by type of worker: (i) women workers received lower wage increases, and their hours worked were significantly and negatively affected, both of which may suggest a failure of the minimum wage to reduce the gender wage gap at the bottom of the distribution, and (ii) the hours worked by young workers were significantly and positively affected, a result that is in agreement with results found elsewhere in the literature. These results persisted after applying robustness checks to account for different control groups, full- vs. part-time jobs, separate regressions for heterogeneous groups, and tests for potential attrition and sample-selection bias. The range of effects observed across disparate groups of workers suggests areas in which policy change could be useful. The income-compression effect we found suggests that further studies should address the effects of minimum wage on the drop in income inequality observed in the data.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.12.004","World Development","Labour economics; Economics; Wage; Minimum wage; Earnings; Difference in differences; Economic inequality; Real income; Panel data; Efficiency wage","en",17,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v116y2019icp77-99.html",3326,"Examined the link between female empowerment and food security in Uganda using household survey data.","Women's decision-making power was positively associated with household dietary diversity.","Integrate women’s empowerment measures into food insecurity strategies to improve nutrition outcomes.","Income poverty",NA

This has important implications for targeting interventions and allocating resources in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Several problems affect the measurement of urban poverty: definitions of ‘slum’ settlements vary widely, data collection may undercount slum populations, insufficient data disaggregation may conceal intra-city disparities, and common indicators and assumptions may be ill-suited to assessing both income and multidimensional poverty in urban contexts. However, not enough is known about the extent to which these issues affect the resulting estimates. This paper contributes to the existing literature by illustrating the scale of the bias associated with common practices in measuring urban poverty at different stages of the production of poverty estimates. The analysis draws on selected examples in the literature alongside new analysis of data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Household Income and Expenditure Surveys.

We model whether children receive a transfer from Bolivia’s CCT program (Bono Juancito Pinto), using data from 811 school-age children and nine ethnic groups. Children from the group least exposed to Westerners (Tsimane’) are 18–22 percentage points less likely to participate in the program than children from other lowland ethnic groups.

"186","WIDER Working Paper - A human rights-consistent approach to multidimensional welfare measurement applied to sub-Saharan Africa","Channing Arndt; Kristi Mahrt; M. Azhar Hussain; Finn Tarp",2018,"Abstract The rights-based approach to development targets progress towards the realization of 30 articles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In current practice, progress is frequently measured using the multidimensional poverty index. While elegant and useful, the multidimensional poverty index is inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights principles of indivisibility, inalienability, and equality. We argue that a first-order dominance (FOD) methodology maintains basic consistency with these principles. Specifically, FOD comparisons are independent of any applied weighting schemes and hence are free from assumptions regarding substitutability between included welfare indicators (indivisibility). FOD cannot be established when welfare in any indicator is deteriorating, no matter how great the advancement is in other indicators (inalienability). Finally, FOD requires that domination occurs throughout the population (equality), implying that welfare gains among better-off groups never offset welfare losses among worse-off groups. We discuss and compare the properties of the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approach and apply both measures to 26 African countries using data near 2002 and 2012. Results across the two measures are broadly similar but not the same. For example, while the multidimensional poverty index suggests that all countries are advancing, FOD indicates that 14 countries experience broad-based progress, two countries show more moderate likelihoods of progress, and the remaining 10 countries neither improve nor deteriorate in terms of attainment of rights for the dimensions considered. We conclude that the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approaches are useful complements that should be employed in tandem.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.022","World Development","Welfare; Declaration; Dominance (economics); Human rights; Political science; Weighting; Consistency (negotiation); Multidimensional Poverty Index; Population; Development economics","en",12,"https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/2588e0e9-2ea0-3ee6-ab95-580d7dfb442d/",3331,"Evaluated the impact of mobile money use on household consumption and savings in Kenya.","Mobile money improved consumption smoothing and encouraged savings among low-income users.","Promote mobile financial services in income poverty policy to strengthen household resilience.","Social protection",NA

Results suggest that Brazilian states that were more exposed to tariff cuts experienced smaller reductions in household poverty and inequality. If significance of results on Brazilian states depends on the choice of poverty and inequality indicators, robust and contrasting results emerge when we disaggregate into rural and urban areas within states. Trade liberalization contributes to poverty and inequality increases in urban areas and may be linked to inequality declines in rural areas (no significant effect on rural poverty appears from our study). In terms of observed integration to world markets, import penetration plays a similar role as trade liberalization for Brazilian states as a whole.

Grundy; Luis Artur; Natasha Ribeiro; Mansour Mahamane; Genevieve Patenaude",2017,"Abstract The charcoal industry is among the most important semiformal economic sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa and a key cash income source for local households who produce it. This has intensified the debate as to the role of income from charcoal production in the alleviation of rural poverty. While in a number of cases charcoal production has been identified as a potential alleviator of monetary poverty, this paper takes as its departure point a lack of analysis on the effect of charcoal income on acute multidimensional poverty (AMP). This is understood as the inability of household members to meet minimum national and international standards and core functionings. This study used primary data from an important charcoal supplying region in southern Mozambique (N = 312). The Alkire-Foster method was used to aggregate AMP in nine composite indicators. Generalised linear models were used to assess the marginal effect of charcoal income on AMP, controlling for other determinants. Our findings show a high intensity (67.7%) and prevalence of AMP (0.429) in the study area (n = 261). 59% of the identified non-monetary poor from charcoal making are identified as acute multidimensionally poor. Charcoal income is found to be positively correlated with valuable household assets, and charcoal production increases the resistance to impoverishment in certain circumstances. However, charcoal income was not found to be a statistically significant determinant of AMP, even for the most productive charcoal makers. This highlights the enormous barriers both producers and non-producers of charcoal alike face in this region in order to overcome AMP. Our findings thus challenge the perception that charcoal income can sufficiently alleviate poverty, particularly when a multidimensional perspective is adopted. Reductions and eventual eliminations of AMP require a concentrated cross-sectional whole-of-government approach to tackle poverty in its multidimensional breadth and complexity, while attempts at making the charcoal industry more inclusive and equitable should be accelerated.","10.1016/j.wdp.2017.11.005","World Development Perspectives","Rural area; Economic sector; Economics; Poverty; Production (economics); Rural poverty; Scope (project management); Multidimensional poverty; Development economics; Charcoal","en",37,"https://core.ac.uk/display/141198401",3335,"Used experimental data from Peru to assess how school feeding programs affect attendance and cognition.","School meals increased attendance but had limited impact on cognitive scores.","Enhance school feeding programs under child poverty policy by pairing nutrition with learning support.","Urban poverty",NA

Urrego; Juan Miguel Villa",2017,"Summary Cash transfer programs have been successful in helping millions of people afford better livelihoods. While this is well known, little research has yet been conducted to examine the power of such programs to influence outcomes in times of conflict, especially in countries where anti-poverty programs are implemented amidst disputes against illegal armed groups. This paper focuses on the implementation of Familias en Accion, a flagship anti-poverty cash transfer program in Colombia, during the early 2000s when the country was still experiencing its long-lasting internal conflict. Impact evaluations have already shown the important effects of this program on household poverty levels and children’s time allocation, including a higher incidence of school attendance and a lower incidence of child labor. Our hypothesis here is that such outcomes imply changes in the dynamics of the civil conflict, since 50% of the demobilised combatants are children mostly eligible for the transfers. We take advantage of a natural experiment that occurred during the first stage of implementation of the program in the period 2001–04 when the transfers were gradually rolled out across eligible municipalities. By setting out a difference-in-differences approach, our results indicate that the program had positive effects on the demobilisation of combatants.

The argument has implications for all rural development programmes and projects, and for the training of staff.

We use a statistically matched dataset from the 2015 Time Use Survey and the Survey on Income and Living Conditions in Turkey to assess the poverty impact not only in terms of official income poverty but also in terms of time-poverty and a combined time- and income poverty measure. We find that increased spending on expansion of ECEC services in the order of 1.8 percent of GDP, generates over a million new jobs, and provides employment for previously non-employed persons, in particular, women. Many job recipient households are lifted above the income poverty threshold reducing the official poverty rate. However, employment into a new job creates a substantial time-poverty effect for women with small children, increasing their time- and income-poverty measure by 50 percent. The positive consumption effects of higher purchasing power (through new jobs and earnings) are dominated by the negative consumption effects of higher time deficits in household production. When newly employed women with small children are also given access to childcare services, their required time for household production decreases by more than one-third, effectively addressing the gendered time poverty. With simultaneous access to ECEC, the time-poverty rates of newly employed women with small children is reduced almost by half and their combined time- and income-poverty rate is reduced by 67 percent. These findings show that employment creation through increased social care spending does not only have the potential to generate a substantial number of jobs in a gender balanced manner, but it also helps to alleviate time- and income poverty and improve gender equality.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105476","World Development","Consumption (economics); Economics; Time allocation; Poverty; Time-use survey; Purchasing power; Production (economics); Unpaid work; Earnings; Demographic economics","en",30,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21000887",3340,"Simulated macro-micro effects of expanding early childhood education and care in Turkey using linked datasets.","Investing 1.8% of GDP created over 1 million jobs and reduced income poverty but increased time poverty for women unless paired with childcare.","Design employment policy that integrates social care services to simultaneously reduce gendered time and income poverty.","Employment; Gender and poverty",NA

Shackleton",2019,"Abstract As the world continues to face widespread food insecurity, achieving food security for all at all times is increasingly complicated. In South Africa, social grants and the use of wild foods have been reported as some ways to improve household food insecurity and reduce poverty. The study examined if social grants and consumption of wild foods alleviate food insecurity in South Africa. Household surveys and focus group discussions were conducted along the rural-urban continuum in three South African towns situated along an agro-ecological gradient. We explored the differences in household food security indicators, mean monthly food expenditure and wealth index between households receiving social grants, households consuming wild foods, and those who did not. Households receiving social grants were more food insecure with lower mean monthly food expenditure and wealth index than those who did not. Overall all towns, the use of wild foods improved household food security which was not true within towns where wild foods were mostly consumed by low income and more food insecure households. Social grants alone cannot eradicate food insecurity as the money is not enough to cater for all household needs whilst wild foods can potentially alleviate household food insecurity. As food prices continue to increase gradually and worsening household food insecurity, ways to shift ‘income circumstances’ of households and promote the use and consumption of wild foods which may increase dietary diversity and diversifying food access. Focus should be placed on capacity building, employment creation and promoting awareness on own food production which is one way to improve food security of poor households rather than depending on purchases from the grant money alone.","10.1016/j.wdp.2019.02.001","World Development Perspectives","Consumption (economics); Business; Poverty; Capacity building; Food prices; Food insecurity; Socioeconomics; Food security; Focus group; Food processing","en",69,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wodepe/v13y2019icp87-94.html",3343,"Surveyed households in three South African towns to assess how social grants and wild foods affect food security.","Wild food use improved food security, while social grant recipients remained vulnerable due to limited purchasing power.","Combine social protection with food self-production strategies to improve food security in low-income communities.","Food insecurity",NA
"193","The more gender equity, the less child poverty? A multilevel analysis of malnutrition and health deprivation in 49 low- and middle-income countries","Hans Ekbrand; Björn Halleröd",2018,"Abstract Mothers are often perceived as key agents in safeguarding the interests of children. If the assumption that women, given the opportunity, are more likely than men to see to the interests of children is true, children can be expected to be less exposed to severe forms of deprivation in countries where women have a relatively strong position in society. The hypotheses that fewer children are exposed to health deprivation and to severe forms of food deprivation in countries where there is a high degree of gender equity are tested. A combination of country-level data and micro-level survey data, makes it possible to analyze whether and to what degree gender equity in a country only benefits children of mothers who have been able to take advantage of a high degree of gender equity or if it also benefits children of less resourceful mothers. The analysis is based on a combination of macro- and micro-data (N = 391,817) from 49 low- and middle-income countries to analyze the relationship between gender equity and malnutrition, and gender equity and health deprivation among children. The results indicate that gender equity in education and employment decreases child malnutrition, and that women’s empowerment decreases health deprivation for children with unschooled mothers. The results support the notion that women are instrumental in children’s welfare. Even when we control for a whole range of both country-level and individual-level factors, gender equity at the country-level still comes out as an important determinant of children’s nutrition and access to health care. Thus, strengthening women’s position is important if we wish to improve children’s living conditions.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.028","World Development","Welfare; Psychology; Health care; Empowerment; Safeguarding; Child poverty; Demographic economics; Multilevel model; Malnutrition; Developing country","en",27,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X1830038X",3344,"Used multilevel analysis of 49 low- and middle-income countries to assess gender equity’s role in child well-being.","Gender equity in education and employment lowered child malnutrition and improved health access even for marginalized mothers.","Strengthen gender equity initiatives to reduce child poverty and enhance health equity.","Child poverty; Food insecurity",NA

This paper examines the Ugandan government’s strategy to reduce rural poverty, the Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA). It argues that, while there appear few better choices of “target” for the PMA than to improve incomes of the rural poor through increased agricultural productivity, emphasis on decentralization as a mechanism for poverty reduction is misplaced in the current political context of Uganda.

Despite a large literature examining subsidies' effects on output and welfare, little is known about their political effects. This paper examines Malawi's Agricultural Input Subsidy Programme, one of the largest and most expensive programs implemented, which was launched by the government in 2005. We examine whether the incumbent party, the Democratic Progressive Party headed by president Bingu wa Mutharika, benefited from Malawi's subsidy program by examining a longitudinal dataset of 1,846 rural Malawians interviewed in 2008 and again in 2010. The individual-level data show no evidence that the subsidy program was targeted to Mutharika's co-ethnics or co-partisans. Our analysis further demonstrates that the subsidy program increased support for the incumbent party. These results suggest that even when parties are unable or unwilling to target distributional programs at the local level, they may nonetheless derive political benefits. As anti-poverty programs - including agricultural subsidies to small-scale farmers - become increasingly common across the continent, our results suggest that they may help to explain patterns of party affiliation and vote choice, particularly where traditional patterns of partisan affiliation related to ethnic or regional identities weaken.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.06.011","World development","Welfare; Agriculture; Agricultural productivity; Government; Economics; Agricultural subsidy; Rural poverty; Economic growth; Fertilizer subsidies in Sub-Saharan Africa; Subsidy","en",81,"https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:87:y:2016:i:c:p:215-226",3353,"Used panel survey data to evaluate the political impact of Malawi’s agricultural subsidy program.","The subsidy boosted support for the ruling party without ethnic targeting.","Integrate transparency and accountability measures into subsidy-driven food insecurity policies.","Food insecurity",NA

Batuo; George Kararach; Issam Malki",2022,"Reducing income inequality is a crucial goal of sustainable development as income inequality often viewed as harmful to economic growth. The main aim of this paper was to empirically assess the macroeconomic and institutional drivers of income inequality in Africa. We use a Kuznets curve framework, which emphasises the role of income per capita in explaining the time path of inequality. In contrast to much of the literature, we explicitly examine the possibility of the existence of multiple income steady states. Using the concept of clubs of convergence, we show that per capita income is divergent and identify four steady states to which groups of economies converge (i.e., high-income to low-income economies). Using panel data models and a data set encompassing 52 African countries spanning the years 1980–2017, we show that once these multiple steady states are accounted for, the Kuznets curve relationship becomes unstable. Our findings suggest that inequality may be increasing in high-income countries in Africa, while decreasing in low-income or the least developed economies. In addition, the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors in explaining income inequality is limited and differ across convergence clubs. Evidence suggests the importance of fiscal, employment and monetary policies and the rule of law to tackle inequality in high-income economies, while they have no statistically significant role in low-income economies' income inequality.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105939","World Development","Economics; Economic inequality; Income inequality metrics; Kuznets curve; Income distribution; Convergence (economics); Inequality; Per capita income; Comprehensive income; Gini coefficient; Panel data; Per capita; Demographic economics; Macroeconomics; Development economics; Econometrics; Public economics; Gross income; Population; Mathematical analysis; Mathematics; Sociology; Demography; Tax reform; State income tax","en",31,"https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/download/ffd17a9aad594bf78b3b2cebe73be4aeea811f216b235d2eee04450c80f11c66/568223/The%20dynamics%20of%20income%20inequality%20in%20Africa.pdf",3354,"Analyzed income inequality drivers in 52 African countries using panel data from 1980–2017.","Inequality trajectories varied by income level, and macroeconomic policies mattered only in high-income countries.","Tailor income poverty strategies by income group, focusing on fiscal tools where they show impact.","Income poverty",NA

Acheampong; Eric Evans Osei Opoku; Godsway Korku Tetteh",2024,"Access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is crucial for disease prevention and improving general health outcomes. However, a significant number of people across the globe still lack access to safe drinking water and practice open defecation. Therefore, evidence-based research is needed to guide policymakers in improving WASH adoption and practice across the globe. In this study, we add to knowledge and policy by probing the role of income inequality and financial inclusion on access to improved WASH facilities using a comprehensive panel dataset from 119 countries between 2004 and 2020. We used the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable regression and the Driscoll-Kraay estimator to account for endogeneity and cross-sectional dependency inherent in panel data, respectively. Our preferred endogeneity and cross-sectional dependency-corrected results show that income inequality reduces access to safe WASH facilities. Our study demonstrates that financial inclusion significantly increases access to safe WASH facilities. Income inequality and financial inclusion have heterogeneous effects on access to safe WASH facilities across rural and urban settings, income groups, and geographical regions. Through our interaction and marginal effect analysis, we document that improvement in financial inclusion reduces the adverse effect of income inequality on safe WASH adoption and practices. These findings highlight that policies that strengthen financial inclusion services and further address income inequality would improve WASH adoption and practices. Considering the inhibiting and enhancing effects of income inequality and financial inclusion, respectively, governments could adopt social welfare policies to tackle the former and also put in measures to enhance financial development and inclusion to enhance the latter.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2024.106573","World Development","Sanitation; Hygiene; Financial inclusion; Inequality; Inclusion (mineral); Environmental health; Economic inequality; Low income; Business; Economics; Development economics; Economic growth; Socioeconomics; Financial services; Medicine; Finance; Psychology; Environmental science; Environmental engineering; Mathematical analysis; Social psychology; Mathematics; Pathology","en",12,"https://pure.bond.edu.au/ws/files/245853813/Unveiling_the_effect_of_income_inequality_on_safe_drinking_water_sanitation_and_hygiene_WASH_Does_financial_inclusion_matter.pdf",3357,"Used data from 119 countries (2004–2020) to study how income inequality and financial inclusion affect WASH access.","Income inequality reduced WASH access, but financial inclusion mitigated this effect.","Expand financial inclusion efforts under income poverty policy to improve global WASH access.","Income poverty",NA
"200","Deep Impact: Geo-Simulations as a Policy Toolkit for Natural Disasters","Asjad Naqvi",2017,"Adverse post-natural disaster outcomes in low-income regions, like elevated internal migration levels and low consumption levels, are the result of market failures, poor mechanisms for stabilizing income, and missing insurance markets, which force the affected population to respond, and adapt to the shock they face. In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but inter-connected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro–meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are “food insecure”. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.015","World Development","Economy; Consumption (economics); Econometrics; Economics; Natural disaster; Market failure; Order (exchange); LEAPS; Agent-based model; Population; Shock (economics)","en",10,"https://core.ac.uk/display/83641808",3359,"Developed an agent-based geo-simulation model to analyze natural disasters' impact on income and food security.","The model captured how spatial and economic vulnerabilities lead to food insecurity after disasters.","Use geo-simulation tools in poverty and migration policy to inform timely, location-specific disaster responses.","Income poverty; Migration and poverty","agent-based model; GIS; migration; food insecurity; Pakistan; earthquake"

In this article, we explore the evolution and politics of drought response intervention in Northeast Brazil and, in particular, in the state of Ceara. Using qualitative data from a series of in-depth key informant interviews across state and municipal levels. We focus both on anti-poverty intervention that, in principle, would increase the capacity of poor households to respond to drought and on specific risk management resources geared towards mitigating drought impact. We find that, on the one hand, the impetus to reform drought response at the state level has decreased rent-seeking and clientelism related to some resources when compared to the authoritarian period, but on the other hand, the persistence of certain forms of paternalism, patronage and clientelism has created a socially undesirable resilient state that has resisted attempts for change.","10.1016/j.wdp.2017.10.003","World Development Perspectives","Political science; Paternalism; Conditional cash transfer; Specific risk; Clientelism; Human development (humanity); Economic growth; Authoritarianism; Qualitative property; Politics","en",22,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452292917300577",3367,"Investigated drought response politics under the Bolsa Família program in Northeast Brazil using key informant interviews.","Social reforms reduced rent-seeking but persistent clientelism and paternalism undermined equitable drought response.","Strengthen drought resilience and climate vulnerability policy by addressing local political barriers to effective social protection.","Climate vulnerability",NA

First, it exhibits the relationship between land and income distribution by developing a theoretical model based on Harris and Todaro (1970) and Lewis (1954). High land inequality increases income Gini coefficients in the urban sector as well as the rural sector, not only by creating congestion in the urban subsistence sector, but also by feeding the growth of the urban reserve army of labor, which pulls down the wages in the urban capitalist sector. Next, the study investigates the empirical relationship between land inequality, level of urbanization and income inequality using cross-country datasets. The estimation results support the theoretical model and indicate that the level of land inequality has a significant impact on determining the level of urbanization, and urban and overall income inequalities. Moreover, the analysis finds that overurbanization increases income inequality. The empirical analysis controls for institutional factors like education inequality and the level of democracy. The results present a stronger evidence on the land inequality’s influence through urbanization than through education and democracy. These results suggest that policymakers should have a broader view as to the importance of agrarian policies. A progressive land reform or/and subsidies protecting small peasantry can also reduce urban income inequality and poverty over the long run.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.01.019","World Development","Income inequality metrics; Labour economics; Agrarian society; Economics; Land reform; Gini coefficient; Distribution (economics); Urbanization; Economic inequality; Income distribution","en; ru",53,"https://gala.gre.ac.uk/15005/",3374,"Developed theoretical and empirical models linking agrarian structures and land inequality to long-term income inequality.","Land inequality increases urbanization and income inequality by expanding the urban labor reserve and depressing wages.","Implement progressive land reform and smallholder subsidies to reduce income poverty and long-term urban inequality.","Income poverty","distribution; urbanization; informality; development.

Iniguez-Montiel",2014,"Summary This paper constitutes an attempt to determine the relative contribution of changes in economic growth and in the distribution of income to changes in poverty in Mexico. Our findings clearly indicate that growth with redistribution (lower income inequality) was the key to reducing poverty continuously and in an important manner during 2000–2006. However, after 2006, decreasing per-capita income, coupled with the persistently high inequality (Gini of 52%), caused the reversal of the favorable trend observed since 1996, raising poverty to pre-2002 levels.

"210","Cultures of entitlement and social protection: Evidence from flood prone Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India","Surpriya Akerkar; PC Joshi; Maureen Fordham",2016,"Sen’s entitlement thesis rooted in social contract theory has been used to explain access to food, and is used by states to design social protection programs as transfer entitlements to diffuse food insecurities. Social protection programs have now burgeoned in several countries as a strategy to enable the poor to overcome risks, vulnerabilities and poverty. These social protection programs have inclusion and exclusion errors, which current theorization attributes mainly to political clientalism, social vulnerability, elite capture, targeting inefficiency, leakages and corruption, lack of information transparency and improper designing of social protection programs. This paper argues that the errors are due to a more fundamental assumption made in application of social contract and entitlement-based approach to social protection programing. It identifies an uncritical application of Sen’s entitlement thesis to social protection programs, as leading to inclusion and exclusion errors. The main problematic, the paper shows is that the social contract-led entitlement thesis works within the domain of formal rights situated within the state-citizen relations, and as such, misses out on the non-formal entitlements and non-state influences that impact materialization of social protection programs in practice. Evidences from flood prone Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India indicate that non-state rules linked with clientele and patronage relations, moral and local political economies trump over formal rights to mediate social protection entitlement outcomes. Rather than abstract state-citizen social contract, it is the moral contracts of reciprocal exchanges with influential patrons embedded in the moral economy of the villages that ultimately ground the social protection entitlement claims of poor villagers. Conceptualizing this process of access as cultures of entitlement, the paper builds a framework for reinterpretation of entitlements and their outcomes, suggesting a recalibration of application of Sen’s entitlement thesis to social protection programs. In conclusion it argues that Sen’s entitlement thesis which is pitched at transfer of economic resources through social protection from the state to the poor is inadequate. Learning from social movements currently leading the transparency and accountability struggles in India, it calls for an instituting and recognition of accountability as new cultural resource and entitlement. In conclusion it argues that information, and accountability as new cultural entitlements, when mobilized through collective agency of the poor can potentially challenge the current cultures of entitlements evidenced in this paper that presently underlie social protection outcomes.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.06.004","World Development","Entitlement; Social movement; Political economy; Sociology; Social change; Social protection; Moral economy; Social vulnerability; Development economics; Social philosophy; Social contract","en",21,"http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/27442/",3382,"Critiqued Sen’s entitlement thesis using ethnographic data from flood-prone Bahraich, India to assess social protection access.","Informal patronage and moral contracts often override formal entitlements in determining access to social protection.","Reform food insecurity policy frameworks to recognize and counter informal power structures affecting program delivery.","Food insecurity",NA

Niaz Asadullah; Antonio Savoia",2018,"Abstract While poverty reduction remains central in the Post-2015 Agenda, its determinants remain debated in the literature, especially the role of structural conditions related to governance. This paper provides an assessment of two key dimensions: the global adoption of MDGs and state capacity. We do so by studying whether they facilitated convergence in income poverty measures, using cross-section and panel methods, with data on 89 developing economies for the period 1990–2013. We find that poverty headcount and gap measures tended to decrease faster in countries with initially higher income poverty. Such convergence accelerated after 2000, suggesting that MDGs adoption was instrumental to poverty reduction. However, this still leaves unexplained substantial variation in poverty reduction performance across countries. Such variation is explained by state capacity: countries with greater ability to administer their territories in 1990 experienced faster income poverty reduction and were more likely to have achieved the MDG target. This result is insensitive to robust regression methods and to a large set of controls (initial level of income, dependence on natural resources, education and health inputs, dependence on foreign aid, ethnic fractionalization, regional effects and a set of governance variables). As good governance and effective institutions are included in the Sustainable Development Goals, this result provides empirical justification for this move, suggesting that more effective states could be crucial to sustain the development progress achieved so far.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.010","World Development","Economics; Poverty; Convergence (economics); Millennium Development Goals; Good governance; Corporate governance; Development economics; Sustainable development; Fractionalization; Developing country","en",87,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X17304035",3386,"Used data from 89 countries (1990–2013) to evaluate how MDG adoption and state capacity influenced poverty reduction.","MDG adoption accelerated poverty reduction, especially in countries with strong state capacity and governance.","Strengthen institutional capacity to sustain post-MDG child poverty reduction and achieve sustainable development targets.","Child poverty",NA

While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388","World Development","Poverty; Development economics; Consumption (sociology); Urbanization; Population; Chronic poverty; Economics; Tanzania; Extreme poverty; Panel data; Basic needs; Standard of living; Geography; Economic growth; Socioeconomics; Poverty reduction; Sociology; Demography; Social science; Econometrics; Market economy","en",9,"https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/files/114584044/wp2022_041.pdf",3387,"Analyzed World Bank panel data (2008–2015) from Nigeria, Tanzania, and Ethiopia to assess urban poverty traps.","Households near the $3.20/day line experience mobility but remain vulnerable, with some stuck at a consumption floor.","Improve urban poverty policy by investing in better data and structural protections for the vulnerable middle.","Urban poverty",NA

This paper evaluates the effect of the PFD to mitigate poverty among the state’s rural Indigenous (Alaska Native) peoples: a population with historically high poverty rates living in a region with limited economic opportunities. Errors in recording PFD income in data used to calculate official poverty statistics cause them to misrepresent poverty in Alaska and understate the effect of the PFD. Estimating poverty rates with and without PFD income therefore requires reconstruction of family incomes from household-level data. Estimated poverty rates from reconstructed income show that the PFD has had a substantial, although diminishing mitigating effect on poverty for rural Indigenous families. The PFD has had a larger effect on poverty among children and elders than for the rural Alaska Native population as a whole. Alaska Native seniors, who receive additional sources of UBI derived primarily from resource rents besides the PFD, have seen a decline in poverty rates, while poverty rates for children have increased.

"215","Transient poverty, poverty dynamics, and vulnerability to poverty: An empirical analysis using a balanced panel from rural China.","Patrick S. Ward",2016,"China's economic reforms starting in the late 1970s have resulted in rapid economic growth, with annual growth in gross domestic product averaging greater than 10 percent per year for more than thirty years. Accompanying this rapid growth in national accounts have been rapid and widespread reductions in poverty. With these reductions in poverty, however, there has often been observed an increase in income inequality, both between as well as within rural and urban sectors. This rising income gap challenges the notion that economic reforms in China have been as successful as the poverty statistics would suggest. In this paper, we suggest that an alternative view would be to consider the effects of these reforms on changing the chronic nature of poverty and reducing household vulnerability to poverty. Using a balanced panel from rural China from 1991 through 2006, we find that most poverty among our sample has shifted from being chronic in nature to being transient, with households either shifting into a state of being non-poor moving in and out of poverty. Among our sample, vulnerability to poverty has been declining over time, but the declines are not uniform over time or space. We decompose household vulnerability status into two proximate causes: low expected income and high income variability, finding vulnerability increasingly due to income variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that vulnerable households have very different characteristics than non-vulnerable households.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.022","World development","Gross domestic product; Rural area; Economics; Vulnerability; Poverty; Household income; National accounts; Development economics; Economic inequality; Panel data","en",143,"https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:eee:wdevel:v:78:y:2016:i:C:p:541-553",3391,"Used panel data (1991–2006) to examine rural poverty dynamics and household vulnerability in China.","Poverty shifted from chronic to transient, with income variability emerging as the main cause of vulnerability.","Design income poverty policies that reduce volatility and support transitions out of poverty in rural China.","Income poverty","China; panel data; poverty; vulnerability"

"218","Cash transfers increase trust in local government","David K. Evans; Brian Holtemeyer; Katrina Kosec",2019,"How does a locally-managed conditional cash transfer program impact trust in government? On the one hand, delivering monetary benefits and increasing interactions with government officials (elected and appointed) may increase trust. On the other hand, it can be difficult for citizens to know to whom to attribute a program and reward with greater trust. Further, imposing paternalistic conditions, and possibly prompting citizens to experience feelings of social stigma or guilt could reduce trust. This study answers this question by exploiting the randomized introduction of a locally-managed transfer program in Tanzania in 2010, which included popular election of community management committees to run the program. The analysis reveals that cash transfers can significantly increase trust in leaders. This effect is driven by large increases in trust in elected leaders as opposed to appointed bureaucrats. Perceptions of government responsiveness to citizens' concerns and honesty of leaders also rise, and these improvements are largest where there are more village meetings at baseline. One of the central roles of village meetings is to receive and share information with village residents, providing some evidence on the value of a high-information environment for generating trust in government. The study also finds that records from school and health committees are more readily available in treatment villages. Notably, while stated willingness of citizens to participate in community development projects rises, actual participation in projects and the likelihood of voting do not. Overall, the results suggest little reason to worry that local management of a conditional cash transfer program reduces trust in government or the quality of governance—especially in high-information contexts.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.020","World Development","Business; Government; Transfer payment; Cash transfers; Local government; Conditional cash transfer; Local election; Public relations; Voting; Community development","en",53,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v114y2019icp138-155.html",3394,"Used a randomized rollout of a community-managed conditional cash transfer program in Tanzania to assess effects on political trust.","Cash transfers significantly increased trust in elected leaders, especially where village meetings were common.","Strengthen transparency and community engagement mechanisms in social protection to build trust in government.","Social protection",NA

"221","The microeconomics of adaptation: Evidence from smallholders in Ethiopia and Niger","Fleur Wouterse; Marina Andrijevic; Michiel Schaeffer",2022,"Climate change is expected to bring higher temperatures, changes to rainfall patterns and in many places increased frequency and severity of extreme weather. Climate change is slated to affect the global food equation both on the supply and demand side as well as local level food systems where small farm communities often depend on local and their own production. As climate change has become more pronounced, the risk to land-based food security faced by many of the world's poor, such as rural communities in Ethiopia and Niger, seems to have become more intense and less predictable. To avoid food insecurity in response to climatic and other stressors, adaptation by small-scale, subsistence farms needs to be accelerated. To effectively intervene to do so, there is a need to understand adaptive behavior in terms of its drivers and its relation with welfare outcomes such as food security. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework of risk and adaptation, use regression and cluster analysis and the most recent version of the Living Standards Measurement Surveys data for rural areas in Ethiopia and Niger, to advance our understanding. We find that adaptation is associated with lower food insecurity in Ethiopia but not in Niger. Formal education appears as a central element of adaptive capacity and is associated with both adaptive production and income strategies. Female-headed households are much less adapted to a changing climate. Perceived risk based on past hazard experience is crucial for adaptation. Results from the cluster analysis confirm that spatial poverty traps exist. To maintain or enhance welfare in the short term and resilience in the long run in the face of a changing climate, policy makers would do well to focus on micro-regions identified as highly food insecure and build adaptive capacity through, for example, gender inclusive education interventions.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105884","World Development","Food security; Adaptive capacity; Subsistence agriculture; Poverty; Climate change; Economics; Welfare; Hazard; Food processing; Development economics; Natural resource economics; Geography; Environmental resource management; Socioeconomics; Agriculture; Economic growth; Ecology; Political science; Market economy; Archaeology; Biology; Law","en",13,"https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/422494/1_s2.0_S0305750X22000742_main.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y",3402,"Analyzed household survey data from Ethiopia and Niger to explore smallholder adaptation to climate stress and its effect on food security.","Adaptation improved food security in Ethiopia but not Niger; education and risk perception were key adaptation drivers.","Target climate vulnerability policies toward education and gender equity to enhance adaptive capacity in rural regions.","Climate vulnerability",NA

Using country-level data on 40 SSA countries from 1996 to 2014 and rainfall deviations as an instrument for agricultural official development assistance (ODA) in fixed-effect estimation settings, this paper examines the 'instantaneous' impact of agricultural ODA on agricultural fixed capital formation in SSA. The question here is whether aid to agriculture does translate instantaneously to building fixed capital urgently needed to address the effect of any potential crisis on food insecurity. Measuring agricultural fixed capital as fixed investments in farm machinery, dams, industrial buildings for agricultural and agro-processing, fences, ditches, drains, etc., we find that capital formation in SSA agriculture improves instantaneously with agricultural ODA inflows. Second, we find that even though rainfall deviations are associated with agricultural ODA inflows to SSA, institutions particularly those designed to control corruption and strengthen rule of law, do matter for agricultural aid inflows to SSA. These results suggest that agricultural ODA is necessary to accelerate agricultural investments and achieve food security.

We also investigate whether and to what extent the common determinants of food insecurity identified in a global model differ across rankings of economic development. Using a series of multilevel linear probability models, we find that the five characteristics associated with the largest increase in the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity around the world are: having low levels of education, weak social networks, less social capital, low household income, and being unemployed.

Using a panel survey in rural Kenya and qualitative material from focus groups and life history interviews from the regions of Makueni and Vihiga, we investigate the changing role of how agriculture and farming practices have contributed to sustained escapes from poverty since 2000. In this study we analyse environmental, social and personal structures that facilitate conversion of agricultural strategies that enable poverty escapes in the context of climate change. Our study identifies that agriculture still forms an essential aspect of Kenyan households’ economic and social wellbeing. However, the study results indicate that links between accumulation of assets and poverty escapes are ambiguous, poor households find it problematic to convert agricultural strategies into a profit, and climate change shocks further exasperate these difficulties. We argue that constraints in conversion structures, such as limited infrastructure, and in conversion processes such as ongoing difficulties in land procurement and inheritance, unsustainable farming practices and continued lack of knowledge on climate-smart agriculture affect not only poverty escapes, but also the ability to adapt to and mitigate against environmental shocks. Development of conversion processes to improve existing conversion structures should be at the core of public interventions that seek to sustainably reduce poverty amidst climate change in rural Kenya.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105705","World Development","Agriculture; Business; Profit (economics); Kenya; Poverty; Procurement; Rural poverty; Context (language use); Development economics; Sustainability","en",31,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100320X",3407,"Combined panel data and life histories from rural Kenya to examine agriculture's role in long-term poverty escapes under climate change.","Asset accumulation didn’t always lead to poverty escapes, due to poor infrastructure and climate-related disruptions.","Invest in rural infrastructure and climate-smart agriculture to enable sustainable poverty reduction in vulnerable regions.","Climate vulnerability; Rural poverty; Urban poverty",NA

We examine spatial variations in hunger and dietary quality using a representative study of 983 households and 440 food retailers in a South African secondary city. Substantial variation existed both between and within urban neighborhoods: high-income neighborhoods were not free of hunger, and low-income neighborhoods varied in diet quality according to individual characteristics. After controlling for income and gender, individual characteristics including access to consumer technologies for food transportation and storage, and informal food assistance from neighbors, were protective against hunger and poor quality diets. Results suggest that meaningful variations exist at smaller geographic units than the city-level or neighborhood-level statistics typically reported in food security research.

"227","does poverty trap rural malagasy households","Anne-Claire Thomas; Frédéric Gaspart",2015,"This paper studies the determinants of poverty dynamics in several rural areas from Madagascar. A particular attention is devoted to testing if rural poverty persistence in Madagascar could be explained by a vicious circle leading to a poverty trap. Annual poverty transitions retrieved from an original household panel data survey covering the 1996-2006 periods show that differences in household and environment characteristics are clearly associated with di¤erences in poverty transitions probabilities. Poverty-vulnerable households have higher dependency ratio and are less educated. They also show different income-generating activities pattern. They cultivate less market-oriented crops and have more vulnerable activities such as agricultural wage work. A Markovian poverty transition model is used to evaluate the role of past poverty in this situation. Past poverty is allowed to have both an intercept and a slope effect on poverty transitions probabilities. Our results show that a substantial share of the di¤erences in household poverty transitions probabilities is attributable to past poverty status. These results encourage the development of social protection to prevent households to fall into a poverty trap as well as speciffic measures to encourage paths out of poverty traps. _________________________________ (francais) Cet article etudie les determinants de la dynamique de la pauvrete dans plusieurs zones rurales de Madagascar.

"228","Legal identity for all? Gender inequality in the timing of birth registration in Mexico","Imke Harbers",2020,"Abstract Despite recent advances, many low and middle-income countries do not have a comprehensive system for civil registration. Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal of providing ‘legal identity for all’ therefore requires an effort to ensure timely birth registration among societal groups that have remained at the margins. Timely registration is crucial for the effective guarantee of individual identities, since delays are associated with under-registration, and incorrect records. The paper examines gender inequality in registration. Based on demographic data for Mexico, a higher middle-income country that has recently made considerable progress with regard to birth registration, it shows that gender bias is expressed not only in the under-registration of girls, but also in systematically longer delays compared to their male counterparts. To understand this, the paper conceptualizes registration as an informed decision by citizens about the perceived costs and benefits of obtaining documents. The paper leverages a novel data source – a dataset of roughly 80 million records for births registered by the Mexican state between 1985 and 2014 – to investigate not just whether citizens obtain documents, but also when they do so. The analysis demonstrates that delays in registration decrease when obtaining documents provides tangible benefits for citizens. The introduction of Progresa, a conditional cash transfer program targeting poor households, is associated with shorter delays in registration among younger cohorts, and an increase in registration among women. Positive incentives for registration thus ensure that parents actively seek documents for their children. Conditional cash transfer programs, which operate in many countries, can play an important role in creating such incentives.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104778","World Development","Cost–benefit analysis; Business; Latin Americans; Identity (social science); Conditional cash transfer; Incentive; Birth registration; Gender inequality; Demographic economics; Sustainable development","en",16,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19304279",3414,"Analyzed 80 million birth records in Mexico (1985–2014) to examine gender disparities in birth registration timing.","Girls experienced longer registration delays than boys, though conditional cash transfer programs reduced this gap.","Incorporate gender equity goals into legal identity and social protection policy to reduce registration delays for girls.","Gender and poverty",NA
"229","Decomposing the Gender Wealth Gap in Ecuador","Boaz Anglade; Pilar Useche; Carmen Diana Deere",2017,"Abstract Unlike the gender earnings gap that has been amply studied, the gender wealth gap has only recently begun to receive attention. Studies of the gender wealth gap have been concentrated on developed countries and have been limited by the use of household-level data. Using individual-level and sex-disaggregated wealth data for Ecuador, this paper examines the pattern of wealth inequality across genders, at different points of the wealth distribution, for sole and then partnered household heads. We use a new Oaxaca-Blinder-type decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression to investigate the sources of the gap at different quantiles. Our results show that among sole heads the gap favors men across the distribution and is largest at the lower tail. Among partnered heads, the gap is much less pronounced throughout the distribution, actually reverting at the lower tail. For both sole and partnered heads, at the lower tail of the distribution, the gender gap is primarily associated with differing returns to covariates. At the median and upper quantiles, gender differences in endowments (ownership of savings accounts, education, and age) drive the gap. Gender bias in inheritance plays a significant role only at lower and median wealth levels. Overall, our results show stark contrasts with results for developed countries and important differences between sole versus partnered heads. Our study also adds evidence to the long-standing debate over whether female household heads are poorer than male heads and calls for the pursuit of wealth-differentiated policies and social programs to increase women’s participation in the formal economy, as well as the returns to their participation.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.02.003","World Development","Savings account; Quantile; Labour economics; Economics; Inheritance; Earnings; Distribution (economics); Inequality; Quantile regression; Developing country","en",13,"https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:96:y:2017:i:c:p:19-31",3415,"Used sex-disaggregated wealth data from Ecuador to decompose the gender wealth gap using quantile regression.","Men had greater wealth at lower quantiles, with differences driven by returns to assets and ownership patterns; inheritance bias mattered at lower levels.","Target asset poverty reduction strategies to increase women’s asset ownership and correct gender disparities in wealth accumulation.","Asset poverty; Health disparities",NA

Yet we find that the determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition, and the magnitudes of their effects, are very nearly the same, although some differentiation in determinants of undernutrition does begin to appear among children 24–60 months old.

However, little is known about how remittances from different origins are used in relation to food insecurity. Using data from the CONEVAL Rural Households Surveys (ENCHOR) of 2013 and 2015, we estimate ordered probit regressions with instrumental variables in order to assess the potentially distinct impacts of international and internal remittances on food insecurity of households in rural Mexico. Our findings show that both kinds of remittances have significant effects on food insecurity. International remittances appear to reduce food insecurity more than internal remittances, although not enough to make remittance-receiving households food secure. The findings suggest that remittances are an important coping strategy but are not sufficient to eradicate the precarious food insecurity of poor households in rural Mexico. Therefore, remittances should be considered as a complementary step to reduce food insecurity levels, but should not replace the government’s responsibility for solving this problem.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105349","World Development","Government; Instrumental variable; Economics; Order (exchange); Quality of life (healthcare); Food insecurity; Demographic economics; Food security; Ordered probit; Developing country","en",46,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X20304770",3417,"Used survey data from rural Mexico (2013, 2015) to estimate how internal and international remittances affect food insecurity.","Both types reduced food insecurity, but international remittances had a greater effect without fully eliminating food insecurity.","Integrate remittance dynamics into food insecurity policy while ensuring government responsibilities are not displaced.","Food insecurity",NA

Examining the long-term productive effects of the Child Support Grant in South Africa","Flora Hajdu; Stefan Granlund; David Neves; Tessa Hochfeld; Franklin Amuakwa-Mensah; Emil Sandström",2020,"Abstract Cash transfers have received increased scholarly and policy attention, as a means of reducing poverty in the global South. While cash transfers are primarily intended to prevent impoverishment and deprivation, several studies suggest they can have 'productive' impacts, contributing to building sustainable livelihoods. However, pilot projects of unconditional cash transfers have often been too brief or too recent to determine how small, but regular, transfers can improve rural livelihoods over time. This paper explores potential long-term productive effects of cash transfers on rural household’s livelihoods. This is done through revisiting, after 14 years, all (273) households in two South African villages included in an extensive livelihood and asset survey in 2002. That survey predated the phasing in of the Child Support Grant (CSG), targeted at impoverished children. When re-surveyed in 2016, some households had cumulatively received significant, while others little or no CSG income. Multivariate regression analysis shows how households that received more CGS income were more likely to invest in productive assets (e.g. small ploughs), and engage in poultry, staple crop and vegetable production. We also found a statistically significant correlation between CSG incomes and growing a larger variety of crops, in an environment generally marked by deagrarianization. However, correlations between receiving more CSG and employment or engagement in informal small-scale trade were not significant. We use data from interviews and observations to explain these processes further. Compared with the paucity of outcomes from other concurrent and costly development interventions in the focal villages, cash transfers have improved livelihoods and living conditions significantly. However, the structural and contextual factors that cause and reproduce poverty remain unaltered, limiting the effects of comparatively small cash transfers. While we show that the cash transfers generate productive livelihood-enhancing effects, they remain insufficient to lift most households out of poverty without further structural changes and developmental interventions.","10.1016/j.wdp.2020.100227","World Development Perspectives","Business; Poverty; Asset (economics); Psychological intervention; Social protection; Production (economics); Cash transfers; Child support; Livelihood; Development economics","en",24,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wodepe/v19y2020ics2452292920300497.html",3418,"Resurveyed 273 South African rural households over 14 years to assess long-term effects of the Child Support Grant.","Cash transfers led to investments in small-scale agriculture and asset accumulation but didn't alter structural poverty causes.","Expand social protection policies to pair cash transfers with structural reforms for lasting rural poverty reduction.","Rural poverty; Social protection",NA

Yet an increasing number of proponents, especially in international development and public policy circles, see basic income as an efficient technological solution to poverty and economic insecurity. Critical development studies scholars have overwhelmingly problematized such ‘rendering technical’ of complex social, economic and political issues. In this paper, we use a critical development lens to point to two areas of particular danger to the transformative potential of basic income: coloniality and class relations. We do so through two case studies: a proposed basic income for Indigenous Australians and the support of UBI by high-net-worth individuals in California’s Silicon Valley. Using these two cases, we argue that despite best intentions, without critical engagement and nuance around questions of power, the radical potential of basic income may be jeopardized, with basic income becoming another technological quick-fix of development and policy interventions.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.06.013","World Development","Public policy; Development studies; Political science; Poverty; Basic income; Degrowth; Development economics; Indigenous; International development; Politics","en",30,"https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:122:y:2019:i:c:p:492-500",3421,"Compared radical and technocratic framings of universal basic income (UBI) using case studies from Australia and California.","Without addressing class and power dynamics, UBI risks becoming a depoliticized technical fix that undermines transformative change.","Design gender and poverty UBI programs that confront structural inequality to retain their transformative potential.","Gender and poverty; Social protection",NA

Though climate change is associated with an increased frequency of extreme weather events, little is known about how multiple environmental shocks in close succession interact to impact household health and well-being. In this paper, we assess how earthquake exposure followed by monsoon rainfall anomalies affect food insecurity in Nepal. We link food security data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey to data on shaking intensity during the 2015 Gorkha earthquake and rainfall anomalies during the 2015 monsoon season. We then exploit spatial variation in exposure to the earthquake and monsoon rainfall anomalies to isolate their independent and compound effects. We find that earthquake exposure alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of food insecurity, likely due in part to effective food aid distribution. However, the effects of rainfall anomalies differed by severity of earthquake exposure. Among households minimally impacted by the earthquake, low rainfall was associated with increased food insecurity, likely due to lower agricultural productivity in drought conditions. Among households that experienced at least moderate shaking, greater rainfall was positively associated with food insecurity, particularly in steep, mountainous areas. In these locations, rainfall events disproportionately increased landslides, which damaged roads, disrupted distribution of food aid, and destroyed agricultural land and assets. Additional research on the social impacts of compound environmental shocks is needed to inform adaptation strategies that work to improve well-being in the face of climate change.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105511","World development","Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Monsoon; Extreme weather; Geography; Distribution (economics); Socioeconomics; Global health; Agricultural land; Food security","en",28,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8128151",3422,"Linked food security data with environmental shock data in Nepal to assess impacts of earthquakes and monsoon anomalies.","Compound shocks increased food insecurity, with droughts and landslides disrupting aid and damaging assets.","Strengthen food insecurity and climate adaptation policies to address cascading effects of compound environmental shocks.","Climate vulnerability; Food insecurity","Food security; Nepal; climate change; drought; earthquake; landslides"

Using country-level data on 40 SSA countries from 1996 to 2014 and rainfall deviations as an instrument for agricultural official development assistance (ODA) in fixed-effect estimation settings, this paper examines the 'instantaneous' impact of agricultural ODA on agricultural fixed capital formation in SSA. The question here is whether aid to agriculture does translate instantaneously to building fixed capital urgently needed to address the effect of any potential crisis on food insecurity. Measuring agricultural fixed capital as fixed investments in farm machinery, dams, industrial buildings for agricultural and agro-processing, fences, ditches, drains, etc., we find that capital formation in SSA agriculture improves instantaneously with agricultural ODA inflows. Second, we find that even though rainfall deviations are associated with agricultural ODA inflows to SSA, institutions particularly those designed to control corruption and strengthen rule of law, do matter for agricultural aid inflows to SSA. These results suggest that agricultural ODA is necessary to accelerate agricultural investments and achieve food security. Our results are robust to sensitivity analysis on the specification of the instantaneous model.","10.1016/j.wdp.2020.100269","World development perspectives","Gross fixed capital formation; Agriculture; Fixed investment; Economics; Development economics; Food security; Sustainable development; Fixed capital; Capital formation; Physical capital","en",19,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33043171/",3405,"Examined conversion structures affecting poverty escapes in Kenya under climate change using household and environmental data.","Poor infrastructure, land access, and lack of climate-smart agriculture knowledge limit effective poverty exit strategies.","Invest in rural climate adaptation infrastructure and support systems to enable sustainable poverty escapes.","Food insecurity","Agricultural aid; Agricultural fixed capital formation; COVID-19 implications; Official development assistance; SDGs; Sub-Saharan Africa"

Hidalgo",2017,"Summary A country’s mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products—as measured by the Economic Complexity Index—have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country’s export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products—or product space—to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy’s level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country’s productive structure may limit its range of income inequality.

Recently experienced contingency may create a mismatch between perceived and actual contingency in an investment decision-making situation, leading to sub-optimal investment behaviour. To test this, we use an experiment with poor farmers in Uganda used to low levels of contingency, as many factors (e.g., the weather, pests, price fluctuations) obscure the link between farm investment and outcomes. We find that in situations in which some contingency is present, investment levels respond positively to recently experienced contingency. In situations in which no contingency is present ('non-contingency'), investment responds negatively to recently experienced non-contingency.

"241","Revisiting the Income Inequality-Crime Puzzle","Matteo Pazzona",2024,"The economics literature generally supports a positive theoretical link between income inequality and crime. However, despite this consensus, empirical evidence has struggled to yield definitive conclusions. To address this puzzle, I conducted a meta-analysis based on 1,341 estimates drawn from 43 studies in economics journals. The findings indicate a statistically significant but economically insignificant true effect of inequality on crime, ranging between 0.007 and 0.123 using UWLS FAT-PET and advanced methods. In essence, if there is an impact of inequality on crime, it is, at best, minimal. Additionally, there is some limited evidence suggesting positive publication bias. Results from Bayesian model averaging reveal that inequality does not affect exclusively property crime, as predicted by the rational choice models. Moreover, this analysis shows that inequality measures which are sensitive to changes in income at the middle and top of the distribution are associated with higher coefficients. The study also underscores the biases arising from the exclusion of relevant variables.

"242","The Livelihood Impacts of Cash Transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa: Beneficiary Perspectives from Six Countries","Eleanor Fisher; Ramlatu Attah; Valentina Barca; Clare O’Brien; Simon Brook; Jeremy Holland; Andrew Kardan; Sara Pavanello; Pamela Pozarny",2017,"Summary Cash transfers (CTs) are a social protection mechanism to reduce the poorest households’ vulnerability to shocks and build human capital by smoothing consumption and sustaining expenditure on education and social welfare. Our study examines whether and how CTs go beyond welfare objectives to promote livelihoods. Presenting a cross-case analysis using original qualitative data on beneficiary perspectives from six African countries—Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Ghana—we explore CT livelihood impacts within household economies and social networks, paying attention to gender issues. We find that a small but predictable flow of cash improves strategic livelihood choices and stimulates productive investments, including through positive effects on beneficiary entry into risk-sharing arrangements and networks for economic collaboration. Levels of household vulnerability and labor constraint nevertheless significantly mediate the ability of CTs to consolidate livelihood outcomes. The varying availability of economic opportunities, plus effective program implementation, also shape livelihood impact. Incorporating beneficiary perspectives brings to the fore the multi-dimensionality of CT effects on experiences of poverty and deprivation, including gender dynamics and intangibles such as dignity and respect; they add powerful realism to the influence of the CT on both immediate survival and livelihood choices. Beyond this, they confirm wider knowledge on productive impact and bring nuance to the conditions under which, and mechanisms by which beneficiaries’ use CTs to build productive capability and assets and to make strategic livelihood choices.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.020","World Development","Economics; Vulnerability; Poverty; Beneficiary; Human capital; Social protection; Cash transfers; Livelihood; Development economics; Social Welfare","en",82,"https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/68625/",3439,"Used qualitative data from six African countries to explore how cash transfers affect household livelihoods and agency.","Cash transfers supported risk-sharing, small-scale investments, and dignity, but were constrained by labor shortages and local conditions.","Design social protection policies that enhance cash transfers' livelihood impacts by addressing local labor and opportunity constraints.","Social protection",NA

Tambo; Idah Mugambi; Mary Bundi; Augustine M. Kara; Charles Owuor",2020,"This study assessed implications of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on household income and food security in two East African countries - Kenya and Uganda, using online survey data from 442 respondents. Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent categories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food. In both countries, participation in national social security schemes was less likely to mitigate respondents' income shock during the COVID-19 period. Conversely, membership in savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105199","World development","Consumption (economics); Business; Poverty; Respondent; Social security; Household income; Livelihood; Socioeconomics; Shock (economics); Food security","en",460,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500897",3440,"Surveyed 442 households in Kenya and Uganda to assess COVID-19’s impact on food security and income.","Food insecurity rose sharply, especially for income-poor and labor-reliant households, while savings groups provided resilience.","Build pandemic-ready food insecurity policies by integrating financial resilience mechanisms like savings and loan groups.","Food insecurity","COVID-19; Coping strategies; Dietary quality; Food security; Probit model; Social security"

Mozambique is chosen as a representative case. We compare scenarios with different gender employment intensities in producing jatropha feedstock for biodiesel. Under all scenarios, biofuels investments accelerate GDP growth and reduce poverty. However, a stronger trade-off between biofuels and food availability emerges when female labor is used intensively, as women are drawn away from food production. A skills-shortage among female workers also limits poverty reduction.

Distilling the various critiques that have emerged around the use of the SLF and sustainable livelihoods approaches, the article highlights problems of theory, method, scale, historical conceptualisation, politics, and debates on decolonising knowledge. It further explores two key shifts in the global development landscape that characterise the 21st century, namely the impacts of climate change on rural livelihoods, and the shifts wrought by globalisation, before highlighting the structural and relational turns in critical development literature. In speaking to both historical critiques and more recent debates, we present a SLF for the 21st century, foregrounding a structural, spatially-disaggregated, dynamic and ecologically-coherent approach to framing rural livelihoods.

"251","The Missing Link Between Parents’ Preferences and Daughters’ Survival: The Moderator Effect of Societal Discrimination","Rebeca Echavarri; Javier Husillos",2016,"The premature mortality of female children is an alarming demographic outcome in many countries of the world. The most popular explanation for this phenomenon is the prevalence of son preference. However, empirical findings indicate that the assumption of a positive relationship between wanted daughters and female children’s survival is not found in every scenario, and it does not have a clear explanation in the literature. To fill this gap, we present a simple model that provides insights into how the positive marginal effect of wanted daughters on their survival might decrease with higher societal discrimination against young females. The model draws on the emerging literature that examines the erosion of cognitive and noncognitive skills that result from poverty and discrimination. Our theoretical findings are tested for the case of India, using the third round of the National Family Health Survey, with zero-inflated Poisson models. Our estimates provide support for the interaction of parents’ preferences and societal discrimination against female children. In particular, we show that the statistical significance of the marginal effect of wanted daughters on their survival disappears in contexts of high societal discrimination against female children. Our study contributes to the literature by questioning the commonly held assumption of additive separability between the effect of family and societal characteristics. One central implication is that the alleviation of poverty alone might fail to automatically reduce sex-based discriminatory practices, and that multidimensional interventions are required that target the individual and society.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.037","World Development","Sociology; Cognition; Poverty; Psychological intervention; Young female; Positive relationship; Family health; Phenomenon; Social psychology; Moderation","en",25,"https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-missing-link-between-parents-preferences-and-daughters-surviv",3455,"Modeled the interaction of parental preferences and societal discrimination on female child survival in India using NFHS data.","Wanting daughters improved survival only in low-discrimination areas; societal bias neutralized parental effects elsewhere.","Design intersectional poverty interventions that simultaneously reduce discrimination and promote gender-equitable family norms.","Intersectional poverty","Psychology of discrimination; children survival; gender; India"

Harris; David Phillips; Maya Goldman; Jon Jellema; Gabriela Inchauste; Karolina Goraus-Tanska",2022,"Abstract Like high-income countries, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) offer reduced rates and exemptions on particular goods and services in their value-added tax (VAT) systems. These policies are often motivated by distributional concerns and target items thought to take up a larger share of the budgets of poorer households. This paper explores the effectiveness of such policies in six LMICs. We estimate their impact on tax revenues, inequality and poverty, and compare these effects to existing cash transfer schemes and a hypothetical Universal Transfer (UT) funded by broadening the VAT base. To do so, we use tax-benefit microsimulation models incorporating input–output tables, allowing us to estimate the impact of exemptions on consumer prices due to VAT embedded in supply chains. We show that although preferential VAT rates reduce poverty, they are not well targeted towards poor households overall. Existing cash transfer schemes are better targeted but generally have limited coverage. A UT funded by a broader VAT base would create large net gains for the poorest households, reducing inequality and most measures of extreme poverty in each of the countries studied. Our results suggest that the widespread practice of providing special VAT treatment to certain goods and services is an expensive way of reaching poor households. In principle, expanding the VAT base and social protection schemes in tandem has the potential to both raise tax revenues and reduce poverty. Such reforms therefore warrant consideration for LMICs as they pursue Domestic Revenue Mobilisation and broader development objectives.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105742","World development","Public economics; Tax revenue; Business; Goods and services; Poverty; Revenue; Social protection; Cash; Cash transfers; Extreme poverty","en",12,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21003570",3456,"Analyzed household-level asset data in India's urban slums to assess intra-urban disparities in living conditions and wealth.","Slums in northern, central, and eastern cities had significantly poorer conditions than those in southern and western India.","Target urban housing insecurity policy toward addressing regional inequities across Indian city tiers and neighborhoods.","Social protection","Cash transfers; Inequality; Microsimulation; Redistribution; Taxation; Value-added tax"

Even if they have been largely criticized as contributing to the commodification of nature, their worldwide application is obvious. The explanation of their diffusion in poor countries and regions can be partially attributed to the fact that PES are promoted as a “win–win” solution, capable of improving sustainable management of natural resources as well as reducing poverty. Inscribed in a liberal conception of poverty, most of the investigations on PES concentrate on the question of access of the poor to PES schemes—as well as to wider markets—on redistribution of benefits and on poor people’s income increase. Studying a Bolivian PES, we show that broadening the foregoing conceptualization of poverty to a more relational understanding allows better taking into account local views and structural determinants of poverty and therefore allows better reporting of the complexity of poverty alleviation implications of such natural resource management initiatives. It is a first and necessary step in designing PES that could increase both natural resource conservation and social justice in marginalized areas.","10.1016/j.wdp.2016.05.001","World Development Perspectives","Ecosystem management; Economics; Culture of poverty; Natural resource management; Poverty; Redistribution (cultural anthropology); Commodification of nature; Sustainable management; Natural resource; Development economics; Economic growth","en",15,"https://core.ac.uk/display/82638886",3458,"Analyzed slum household data to explore how city-level factors shape infrastructure access and living standards.","Larger cities offered better services, but these gains were uneven and highly dependent on regional development.","Scale equitable urban development under housing insecurity policy to close infrastructure gaps in smaller cities.","Housing insecurity",NA

Informal settlements therefore challenge governance by standards. We argue that quantifying and interrogating differences offers a better basis for governance. By drawing on a comparative analysis of three different informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa, this paper explores what differences reveal about the governance of informal settlements. The paper uses an urban societal metabolism approach, focussed on gender, energy and health, based on questionnaires and focus group discussions in Enkanini (Stellenbosch, South Africa), Mathare (Nairobi, Kenya), and Kasubi-Kawaala (Kampala, Uganda). The contribution of the paper is both empirical and theoretical. Empirically, we provide new evidence about the metabolism of urban informality at multiple levels of analysis: the individual, the household and the settlement. Findings show the gender asymmetries in urban poverty and the intricate links between energy choices, health and economic status. Theoretically, we argue that different levels of analysis produce different understandings of urban informality, and that analyzing informal settlements only by population aggregates means missing information. We conclude by arguing that understanding differences leads to the formulation of modest and localised goals, which are better able to take into account the complexity of urban informality.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.06.026","World Development","Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Development studies; Economic geography; Settlement (litigation); Population; Corporate governance; Urban planning; Phenomenon; Focus group","en",39,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19301792",3459,"Compared intra- and inter-city slum inequality using national-level urban survey data in India.","Differences between cities contributed more to inequality than differences within cities themselves.","Prioritize housing reforms that address city-to-city disparities rather than solely intra-city slum upgrading.","Urban poverty",NA

We examine the consequences of imperfect compliance by looking at the heterogenous effects of minimum wages across compliance regimes in India from 1999-2011. We find noncompliance rates as high as 90% for some unskilled workers in India. We show that minimum wages have a positive effect on wages, without a corresponding effect on employment. As a result, household consumption increases following increases in the minimum wage; however, compliance matters.

The analysis uses a unique panel data set constructed for the purpose of this paper. It contains district inequality measures based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, data on disaster affected population and other economic and social indicators. Employing a panel fixed effects estimator, we find that contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as measured by the Theil index. Findings are robust across various inequality metrics, sub-samples and alternative estimators such as Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM. However, natural disasters do not affect household expenditure inequality. Either households behave as if they have a permanent income or all households reduce their expenditure proportionately irrespective of their income level in responding to natural disasters. Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality. Income of richer households is mainly derived from non-agricultural sources such as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities.

Bettencourt",2021,"Abstract The emergence of India as an urbanized nation is one of the most significant socioeconomic and political processes of the 21st century. An essential feature of India’s urbanization has been the growth and persistence of slums in its fast-developing cities. Whether living conditions in Indian slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap to much of their population is therefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we analyse data from the Census of India using the framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative properties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such as access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. We find that slums in larger cities attract more migrants and offer, on average, higher levels of service access than those in smaller cities. We posit that these outcomes are a consequence of both agglomeration effects in larger cities and sub-linear scaling of infrastructure as predicted by urban scaling theory. We also find consistent under-performance in service access in slums, in comparison with non-slum neighborhoods in the same cities. However, urban slums, on average, offer greater access to services than rural areas. This situation, which we quantify systematically, may help explain why larger Indian cities have remained attractive to rural populations in terms of living standards, beyond the need for an economic income premium. Finally, based on the analysis of scaling residuals, we construct a nationwide urban geography of slums, essentially finding that public service delivery in the slums of northern, central, and eastern Indian cities is, on average, poorer than slums in cities of southern and western India. Overall, these findings suggest that urban policy needs to confront two distinct kinds of urban inequity – across neighbourhoods within cities, and across city scales and levels of development.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105435","World Development","Rural area; Standard of living; Socioeconomic status; Geography; Poverty trap; Population; Urbanization; Socioeconomics; Urban geography; Service delivery framework","en",23,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v142y2021ics0305750x21000474.html",3466,"Analyzed household asset data to examine spatial inequalities in slum conditions within and across Indian cities.","Inter-city disparities were more significant than intra-city ones, indicating structural policy gaps.","Revise national housing insecurity frameworks to account for regional policy failures driving inter-city inequality.","Housing insecurity",NA
"260","“Food aid is killing Himalayan farms”. Debunking the false dependency narrative in Karnali, Nepal","Yograj Gautam",2019,"Abstract Food aid constitutes a heated debate in development discourse. In Nepal’s Himalayan region, it is blamed for aggravating food insecurity by inducing dependency and negatively affecting local agriculture and diet patterns. Transferring large amount of rice, a grain scantily produced locally, food aid is considered to have worsened human nutrition by directing the traditionally diverse diet to rice-based monotonous diet. The aid dependent farmers are alleged to have given up cultivating land for less preferred local grains, ultimately reducing local food production and reproducing the need for more aid. Therefore, the removal of food aid is considered indispensable to the achievement of self-sustained food security. This paper examines the dependency narrative in light of empirical data produced by a mixed-method study conducted in Humla, a highly food insecure district in western Nepal. The results show no indication of ‘dependency’ as alleged in the narrative. Despite the free/concessional food transfers, the local farms have not only maintained diverse traditional crops, recent agricultural innovation has actually increased on-farm crop diversity. On average, the local grains contribute about 65% of the total local consumption signifying a diet pattern well embedded with the local food system. Food aid transfers cover about 20% of the total food need and constitute an important resource for households suffering high food scarcity. Therefore, we argue that the idea of removing food aid in the guise of “dependency” will directly affect many poor farmers’ food access, and will also leave an increased number of Himalayan farmers vulnerable to food insecurity in the face of emerging environmental and socio-economic stresses.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.12.001","World Development","Scarcity; Agriculture; Consumption (economics); Business; Resource (biology); Crop diversity; Agricultural economics; Food security; Food systems; Food processing","en",17,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v116y2019icp54-65.html",3468,"Investigated whether food aid induces dependency and reduces crop diversity in food-insecure Nepalese Himalayan regions.","Despite aid, local farms maintained diverse crops, with aid covering only 20% of needs and supporting food access.","Continue targeted food aid under food insecurity policy to supplement household resilience without harming agricultural diversity.","Food insecurity",NA

Proactively mobilizing the youth as a resource in the creation of sustainable livelihoods can potentially be a win-win-win solution that Ethiopia is currently attempting. The new youth employment strategy includes allocation of rehabilitated communal lands to youth groups. This study investigates the extent to which Ostrom’s Design Principles (DPs) are followed and matter for the early performance of youth groups in terms of their stability, trust and overall performance. Data from a census of 742 youth groups in five districts in Tigray in northern Ethiopia is used. This study utilizes econometric methods to assess correlations between the DPs and a range of early performance indicators. The study contributes to the limited literature on local collective action utilizing large samples. We find a high degree of compliance with the DPs. Some of the DPs appeared more important for early performance of the youth groups. The Ethiopian youth group approach to mobilize landless and unemployed youth is promising and should be tested elsewhere. Further longitudinal research is needed on the Ethiopian model as it is still at an early stage of testing as most groups are less than five years old.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.010","World Development","Performance indicator; Resource (biology); Political science; Collective action; Youth unemployment; Livelihood; Business model; Economic growth; Population growth; Resource management","en",17,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp10-30.html",3471,"Analyzed 742 youth groups in Ethiopia to assess the impact of Ostrom’s Design Principles on employment outcomes.","Groups that followed more design principles had higher early performance, trust, and stability.","Scale community-based youth employment strategies under employment policy by embedding proven governance frameworks.","Employment",NA
"263","Too little but not too late: nowcasting poverty and cash transfers’ incidence during COVID-19’s crisis","Matías Brum; Mauricio De Rosa",2020,"The economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 has caused a world-wide economic downturn, and the deepest GDP contraction in Latin America since the beginning of the XX th century. One of the most dramatic outcomes of the crisis is the increase in poverty, but its extent will remain unknown until household income data is collected and analyzed. We propose a simple approach to provide early estimates, micro-simulating the short-run effect of the crisis on the poverty rate. It combines household level micro-data, estimates on the feasibility of working from home, information on key public policies (e.g., cash-transfers, unemployment insurance), and forecasts of GDP contraction. This approach, which can be easily adapted and applied to different countries, allows to nowcast the current poverty level and the poverty-reducing effect of public policies, while providing full micro-macro consistency between heterogeneous impacts on households and the shock to aggregate GDP. Moreover, it enables to estimate the effect on informal and self-employed workers, of utmost importance in developing countries. We illustrate the methodology with an application for Uruguay, finding that during the first full trimester of the crisis, the poverty rate grew by more than 38%, reaching 11.8% up from 8.5%. Moreover, cash transfers implemented by the government in the period had a positive but very limited effect in mitigating this poverty spike, which could be neutralized with additional transfers worth under 0.5% of Uruguay's annual GDP.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105227","World development","Public policy; Latin Americans; Economics; Poverty; Recession; Unemployment; Cash transfers; Household income; Development economics; Developing country","en; es",30,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34580558/",3474,"Used micro-simulation to estimate COVID-19’s poverty impact and the effectiveness of government transfers in Uruguay.","Poverty rose over 38%, and existing cash transfers had only modest mitigating effects.","Expand emergency transfer programs in social protection policy to cushion vulnerable populations during economic crises.","Social protection","COVID-19; Latin America; Microsimulations; Nowcasting; Poverty; Uruguay"

rush in extensive and complex ways, the impacts of which affect villagers profoundly. These interconnections occur in direct and indirect ways and are often subtle, but that does not make them less important;
it only makes the challenge of governing such dynamics in the interests of marginalized working poor

Examining empirical cases in Northern Shan State in Myanmar, we conclude that these interconnections

(ii) a legitimating process for land grabs, or (iii) a de-legitimating process for people’s climate change mitigation and adaptation practices. These interconnections in turn stoke old and provoke new political axes

Westengen; Morten Jerven",2023,"The Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is one of the most central indicators informing the international development agenda. Reported annually by the Rome-based UN agencies in their flagship report The State of Food Insecurity in the World, it is generally considered an authoritative statistic on world hunger. Based on archival research, this article chronicles and analyzes the development of its statistical model and the political and historical context of its revisions. We show that revisions to the PoU model have led to substantial changes in the estimates of the indicator and that this has underpinned shifting policy narratives and trends in the fight against hunger. Major changes in the statistical model inverted the PoU's trend lines towards the end of the Millennium Development Goals period. In 2020, the year after China's candidate became Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN organization accessed new historical datasets from China and dramatically reduced PoU estimates for the country and consequently also the global figures. A number of ad-hoc revisions have been made to render food security crises - associated with inflation, economic recession, and the Covid-19 pandemic - legible. The indicator has thus been shaped by the political and economic structures within which FAO is situated, serving as an important tool to legitimize shifting ambitions and strategies of the post-World War II development agenda. At the same time, the lack of access to national household survey data from the countries with the highest measured undernutrition makes the PoU estimates fundamentally uncertain. At a technical level, this study highlights the need for greater transparency in the data and modelling basis for the PoU. The entanglement of technical and political factors illustrates the necessity of critical research on food insecurity quantification. More multifaceted approaches to measure food insecurity are needed.","10.1016/j.wdp.2023.100504","World Development Perspectives","Food security; Context (archaeology); Politics; China; Political science; Economic growth; Development economics; Recession; Geography; Agriculture; Economics; Law; Archaeology; Keynesian economics","en",8,"https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/11250/3123403/1/Iversen_History%2bof%2bHunger_World%2bDev%2bPerspectives.pdf",3477,"Traced political and statistical shifts in the FAO’s Prevalence of Undernourishment indicator over time.","Revisions significantly changed global hunger trends, raising concerns about transparency and data access.","Develop transparent, multi-source indicators in food insecurity policy to improve global accountability and planning.","Food insecurity",NA

However, the daily struggles and embodied experiences of low-skilled women entrepreneurs in informal economies, as well as precarious and unequal intermittent water environments, have been insufficiently understood. We analyse how women strive for and negotiate their independence through spatiality and how services, specifically water, affect their ability to develop their business spaces. The evidence derives from five studies, using mixed methods, conducted in the small town of Wukro, Ethiopia. The methods used were household surveys, a water diary, and interviews with women entrepreneurs - owners of coffee, alcohol, and hair salons businesses. Our study finds that they develop their businesses through the simultaneous presence of various, multilevel spaces of marginality/paradoxical spaces and articulation of independence as control over one's business and body. Unlike the positive term 'empowerment', the lens of negotiating 'independence' integrates spaces of conflicting subjectivities, where marginality and resistance, suffering and claimed control, interpellation, and re-construction of own identities are simultaneously present. We suggest that water struggles are analysed not only through the evaluation of water shortages and unequal geographical sectorization but also through the perspective of 'water precarity' (Sultana, 2020) as in our study it was a water-induced lack of control over businesses and daily lives that caused the most suffering.

Brown; Adam Daigneault; Emilia Tjernström; Wenbo Zou",2017,"Natural disasters give rise to loss and damage and may affect subjective expectations about the prevalence and severity of future disasters. These expectations might then in turn shape individuals' investment behaviors, potentially affecting their incomes in subsequent years. As part of an emerging literature on endogenous preferences, economists have begun studying the consequences that exposure to natural disasters have on risk attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. We add to this field by studying the impact of being struck by the December 2012 Cyclone Evan on Fijian households' risk attitudes and subjective expectations about the likelihood and severity of natural disasters over the next 20 years. The randomness of the cyclone's path allows us to estimate the causal effects of exposure on both risk attitudes and risk perceptions. Our results show that being struck by an extreme event substantially changes individuals' risk perceptions as well as their beliefs about the frequency and magnitude of future shocks. However, we find sharply distinct results for the two ethnicities in our sample, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; the impact of the natural disaster aligns with previous results in the literature on risk attitudes and risk perceptions for Indo-Fijians, whereas they have little to no impact on those same measures for indigenous Fijians. To provide welfare implications for our results, we compare households' risk perceptions to climate and hydrological models of future disaster risk, and find that both ethnic groups over-infer the risk of future disasters relative to the model predictions. If such distorted beliefs encourage over-investment in preventative measures at the cost of other productive investments, these biases could have negative welfare impacts. Understanding belief biases and how they vary across social contexts may thus help decision makers design policy instruments to reduce such inefficiencies, particularly in the face of climate change.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.002","World development","Public economics; Welfare; Ethnic group; Psychology; Natural disaster; Social protection; Endogenous preferences; Loss and damage; Affect (psychology); Indigenous","en",153,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17303893",3479,"Analyzed how exposure to Cyclone Evan affected risk perceptions and beliefs in Fiji households across ethnic groups.","Risk perceptions became exaggerated post-disaster, especially among Indo-Fijians, potentially distorting investment behavior.","Incorporate behavioral risk assessments into climate vulnerability policy to mitigate overreaction and improve resource allocation.","Climate vulnerability",NA

Using this model, different regions of the world (East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa) are compared. For many poorer, partially capitalized societies, people’s security relies informally upon various clientelist relationships.

In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.025","World Development","Outbreak; Agriculture; Qualitative research; Geography; Organizational Affiliation; Food insecurity; Livelihood; Socioeconomics; Economic growth; Coping (psychology)","en",68,"https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:93:y:2017:i:c:p:136-152",3484,"Surveyed 368 Nicaraguan households to assess food insecurity and coping with environmental shocks.","Larger farms and diversified food production reduced hunger, while past negative coping predicted future vulnerability.","Support resilient farming practices in food insecurity and climate vulnerability policy to reduce hazard-driven hunger cycles.","Climate vulnerability; Food insecurity",NA

But changing circumstances since the mid-1980s, in particular the ‘African food crisis’ and its aftermath, raised questions about the effectiveness of these international arrangements to cope in future with an extremely serious and widespread period of food insecurity. Coping with shortfalls in local food supply was made more difficult by sharp price variability in world markets for cereals and other foodstuffs and by barriers to food security imposed on developing countries by the world agricultural trade regime. The combination of the volatile cereal markets and budgetary tightening in the late 1980s, especially in the United States, underscored the real opportunity costs of food aid as a developmental and humanitarian resource transfer.","10.1007/978-1-349-23138-6_10","Market Forces and World Development","Economic policy; Agriculture; Economics; International economics; Food supply; Food insecurity; Food aid; Food security; Opportunity cost; Coping (psychology); Developing country","en",1,"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-349-23138-6_10",3490,"Reviewed global trends in food aid policy effectiveness since the 1970s, especially during market shocks.","Volatile cereal markets and declining donor commitment reduced food aid’s stabilizing role.","Reinvest in predictable, needs-based food insecurity policy to safeguard developing countries during supply crises.","Food insecurity",NA

Sovacool",2018,"Summary Bangladesh contributes little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country’s National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.014","World Development","Psychological resilience; Sociology; Vulnerability; Environmental degradation; Elite capture; Harm; Public sphere; Development economics; Commons; Economic growth; Political ecology","en",131,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17303285",3492,"Reviewed Bangladesh’s climate adaptation efforts and their unintended effects on inequality and exclusion.","Adaptation projects often enabled elite capture, exclusion, and environmental harm, worsening vulnerability.","Revise climate vulnerability policy to center equity and prevent displacement and marginalization in adaptation planning.","Climate vulnerability; Income poverty","BWDB, Bangladesh Water Development Board; CDS, Coastal Development Strategy; GBM, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna river basins; GHG, greenhouse gas; MOEF, Ministry of Environment and Forests; NAPA, National Adaptation Program of Action; UNFCCC, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"

Especially, we explore how this result is driven by the uncertainty faced by MFIs in their location decision i.e., they can hardly predict accurately whether or not they will perform financially. Furthermore, we find that MFIs are spatially clustered and identify three main reasons for this: common attraction factors i.e., the characteristics of one area fits to the preferences of all MFIs so that they are all located in the same areas; payoff externalities to be collocated; and herd behavior, i.e., MFIs follow one another. Most importantly, we find that a significant part of this herding process is rational, i.e., early locations of MFIs convey information used by later ones such that it reverses or neutralizes the negative impact of uncertainty resulting then in more locations in needier areas. Since it allows them to be located in poorer areas, MFIs improve the achievement of their social goal. This latter result is rather good news for those who reckon that a better access to financial services enhances economic growth and fosters poverty alleviation. Indeed, rational herding constitutes an endogenous moderator effect to the big issue that financial services penetration is too weak in the poorest rural areas.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.02.004","World Development","Public economics; Herd behavior; Rural area; Financial services; Externality; Economics; Herding; Poverty; Microfinance; Economic growth; Location","en",15,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16000395",3493,"Analyzed the geographic distribution of microfinance institutions in Pakistan and how uncertainty influences their location decisions.","MFIs tend to cluster spatially, and a rational herding process helps them eventually reach poorer areas despite initial uncertainty.","Support strategies that strengthen rational information sharing among MFIs to expand financial access in underserved rural areas.","Financial inclusion","microfinance institutions; location decisions; uncertainty; rational herding; panel Poisson regression"

We construct a new database of studies of these programs that report impacts on food security outcomes and asset formation. Our meta-analysis finds that social protection programs improve both the quantity and quality of food consumed by beneficiaries. The magnitudes of these effect sizes are meaningful. The average social protection program increases the value of food consumed/expenditure by 13% and caloric acquisition by 8%. Food expenditure rises faster than caloric acquisition because households use transfers to improve the quality of their diet, most notably increasing their consumption of calories from animal source foods. Since the consumption of animal source foods in these populations is low, and because there are significant nutritional benefits to increasing the consumption of these, this is a positive outcome. Our meta-analysis also finds that social protection programs lead to increased asset holdings as measured by livestock, non-farm productive assets, farm productive assets, and savings.

We apply unconditional quantile regression to analyze the variations in the premiums of party membership across the wealth distribution. Our results show that although the average wealth gap between CCP and non-CCP households remained substantial and consistent throughout the period, there have been significant shifts in the returns structure of party membership over time. Prior to the housing reform in the 1990s, the highest wealth premiums of CCP households were primarily concentrated in the middle of the distribution, but now they are concentrated at the bottom of the distribution. This is mainly attributed to the fact that CCP households at the lower end of the net wealth distribution are more inclined to possess housing assets, which tend to have higher value compared to those owned by non-CCP households. These effects fade out in the top half of the net wealth distribution, where the differences between CCP and non-CCP households become less apparent. Furthermore, by utilizing a balanced household panel from 2013 to 2017, we were able to track wealth accumulation at the household level.

Imai",2020,"Abstract As India’s population has been ageing due to declines in fertility and mortality rates, more policy emphasis has been placed on reducing poverty among the elderly. The present study aims to examine the effect of Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) on household welfare indicators, such as consumption expenditure, income, assets, and poverty. Using the household longitudinal data based on the India Human Development Survey in 2004–5 and 2011–12, we have applied the Propensity Score Matching to build a counterfactual group and have used the propensity-score weighted fixed effects model to eliminate time-invariant unobservable household characteristics. The results show that the IGNOAPS participation increased consumption expenditure, food and non-food expenditure and assets, while reducing the household labour supply. The sub-sample estimations show that these effects are observed only when recipients are women. However, the results of Difference-in-Difference model imply that the poverty-reducing effect deteriorated in 2011–12 after the government made several changes to programme specifications in 2007. This was likely because some households which accessed IGNOAPS after 2007 reduced the labour supply significantly while keeping the level of consumption.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105017","World Development","Welfare; Economics; Poverty; Labour supply; Pension; Human development (humanity); Population; Demographic economics; Fixed effects model; Fertility","en",42,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v134y2020ics0305750x20301431.html",3500,"Used panel data from the India Human Development Survey (2004–05 and 2011–12) to assess the impact of the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme on household welfare.","The program improved consumption and assets, particularly for female recipients, but its poverty-reducing effect weakened after 2007 policy changes.","Revise social protection programs to maintain their poverty-reduction impact by reinforcing eligibility and targeting mechanisms for women.","Social protection",NA

Empirical evidence from Mexico","Matthieu Clément; Lucie Piaser",2021,"Abstract Deeply rooted in the social disorganization theory, this article aims at studying the causal impact of local inequality, a main community structural factor, on individuals’ fear of crime. Combining multiple datasets and focusing on the Mexican case, this study has several goals. First, we construct an innovative index of fear of crime composed of three dimensions: emotion, cognition and behavior. Second, we build measures of income and education inequality representative at the municipal level. Lastly, we assess the causal effect of inequalities on fear of crime, controlling both for the hierarchical structure of the data and endogeneity bias relying on two-stage least squares (2SLS) multilevel models. Our results suggest a strong positive linear relationship between municipal income inequality and fear of crime. However, the observed effect is stronger for the emotive and behavioral dimensions. Concerning education inequality, we also find a positive impact on feeling of unsafety (emotive dimension), but of smaller magnitude, and on risk perception (cognitive dimension). While our results are robust to different robustness checks for income inequality, they are less stable for education inequality.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105354","World Development","Psychology; Risk perception; Empirical evidence; Fear of crime; Social disorganization theory; Inequality; Economic inequality; Multilevel model; Endogeneity; Social psychology","en",10,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v140y2021ics0305750x20304824.html",3504,"Combined multiple Mexican datasets to examine how municipal-level income and education inequalities influence fear of crime.","Higher income inequality strongly correlates with greater fear of crime, especially emotional and behavioral responses; education inequality also had a smaller effect.","Strengthen urban policy efforts to reduce income disparities as a strategy to mitigate fear and improve public safety perceptions.","Education access",NA

Some Empirical Evidence from Ethiopia","Bob Rijkers; Caterina Ruggeri Laderchi; Francis Teal",2010,"Summary The Addis Ababa Integrated Housing Development Program (AAIHDP) aims to tackle the housing shortage and unemployment that prevail in Addis Ababa by deploying and supporting small enterprises to construct low-cost housing using technologies novel for Ethiopia. The motivation for such support is predicated on the view that small firms create more jobs per unit of investment by virtue of being more labor intensive and that the jobs so created are concentrated among the low-skilled and hence the poor. To assess whether the program has succeeded in biasing technology adoption in favor of labor and thereby contributed to poverty reduction, the impact of the program on technology usage, labor intensity, and earnings is investigated using a unique matched workers-firms dataset, the Addis Ababa Construction Enterprise Survey (AACES), collected specifically for the purpose of analyzing the impact of the program. We find that program firms do not adopt different technologies and are not more labor intensive than nonprogram firms. There is an earnings premium for program participants, who tend to be relatively well educated, which is heterogeneous and highest for those at the bottom of the earnings distribution.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.10.007","World Development","Labour economics; Economics; Empirical evidence; Productivity; Investment (macroeconomics); Unemployment; Production (economics); Earnings; Labor intensity; Unit (housing)","en",8,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X09001818",3505,"Evaluated the impact of Addis Ababa’s housing program on labor intensity and earnings using matched worker-firm data.","Program firms did not adopt more labor-intensive methods, but participants earned more, especially those at the lower end of the wage distribution.","Target employment programs more directly to low-skilled workers to enhance their poverty-reduction effectiveness.","Employment",NA
"279","Is farmer-to-farmer extension effective? The impact of training on technology adoption and rice farming productivity in Tanzania","Yuko Nakano; Takuji W. Tsusaka; Takeshi Aida; Valerien O. Pede",2018,"Abstract Agricultural training is a potentially effective method to diffuse relevant new technologies to increase productivity and alleviate rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers’ technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the conventional farmer training approach.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.013","World Development","Agriculture; Business; Econometric model; Hectare; Productivity; Emerging technologies; Agricultural extension; Rural poverty; Agricultural science; Panel data","en",218,"https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:336-351",3507,"Compared technology adoption and rice yields among trained and untrained farmers in Tanzania using five-year household panel data.","Proximity to trained farmers significantly boosted technology adoption and increased yields among untrained farmers over time.","Scale up farmer-to-farmer training programs to cost-effectively spread agricultural innovation and improve rural productivity.","Urban poverty",NA

It finds that three-quarters of the average household income in the Sahel sample and half of the same in the Sudanian sample come from non-cropping sources. These are more diversified regionally and sectorally in the case of the Sahel. The latter's non-cropping income is less covariant with the local cereal economy than is the case in the Sudanian sample.

Sovacool; May Tan-Mullins; Wokje Abrahamse",2018,"Abstract Disaster recovery efforts form an essential component of coping with unforeseen events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and typhoons, some of which will only become more frequent or severe in the face of accelerated climate change. Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.028","World Development","Disaster recovery; Political economy; Business; Development studies; Natural disaster; Environmental degradation; Corporate governance; Political ecology; Emergency management; Politics","en",63,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18301761",3513,"Analyzed four disaster recovery cases to develop a typology of social and ecological risks in post-disaster reconstruction.","Recovery processes often involved exclusion, privatization, and environmental degradation, reinforcing inequality.","Implement recovery policies that integrate equity and environmental safeguards to avoid deepening vulnerability post-disaster.","Climate vulnerability","Political ecology Political economy Enclosure Resistance Disaster relief Climate change adaptation Exclusion Related academic disciplines Resource economics; geopolitics; political geography; political science; economic geography Human geography; ecology; political geography; sociology; peasant studies Environmental sociology; law; jurisprudence; philosophy; ethics; energy policy Development studies; development economics; political geography; political science; International political economy"

This study aimed at assessing the gender difference in mobile phone ownership among youth business group members, and how it affects election into leadership and group board positions in rural youth business groups in northern Ethiopia. We used instrumental variable methods on survey data on 1125 youths in 119 youth business groups where 32% of the members were female. Our results indicated that 37% of the females and 70% of the males owned mobile phones. Male members were twice as likely to become board members and five times as likely to become group leaders. Mobile phones had become instrumental for male members to become group leaders and board members while this was not the case for female members. Male members without mobile phone were not significantly more likely to become board members or group leaders than female members without and with mobile phones. The gender digital divide is thus a question of both ownership and the use of mobile phones for business and for getting positions that can empower women in business.

Sankima",2024,"Armed conflicts are among the major disruptions affecting local food systems in low- and middle-income countries, having devastating effects on populations' food security. The understanding of the mechanisms linking conflicts to food insecurity is limited, however, by a lack of data on how these conflicts affect the different actors of local food systems. In this study, we aim to address this gap, using empirical data from the northeast region of Burkina Faso where an active conflict is occurring. The objective is to document and analyze the impacts of that conflict on the functioning of the local food system and more specifically on the resilience of the traders that operate from Sebba, the capital of the Yagha province. The analysis reveals, first, the magnitude of the disruption. On average, these local food traders experienced a 40%-50% contraction in their activities compared to the situation prior to the conflict. Not all operators are affected with the same intensity, however. Transporters appeared to be impacted more severely than retailers/vendors. Econometric models are then used to explore the socio-economic characteristics of these different actors. The analysis shows that, contrarily to what is often observed with farmers, the level of assets did not seem to contribute significantly to traders' resilience. Instead, having recently relocated to Sebba appears more important to ensure the level of adaptability needed to respond to the rapidly deteriorating situation. The analysis also reveals that the resilience of the ""positive deviants"" (those operators who did better than the rest of the group) materialized essentially through their capacity to buffer more effectively shocks' impacts but it did not spare them from facing drastic contractions in their trade business. Eventually, the resilience of those positive deviants was not sufficient to maintain the resilience of the whole system. It ensues a catastrophic drop in the quantity of food traded (up to 50% for certain products), leading to the collapse of the system and a 10-fold increase in the food insecurity of the local population. The paper concludes by weighing the usefulness of the concept of resilience in the context of severe disruptions of the food systems (such as armed conflicts), emphasizes the risk that an unconditional promotion/adoption of that concept may reduce our ability to anticipate or even to envision collapse scenarios. On the brighter side, our analysis demonstrates that collecting specific information about the food system operators can help predict, and possibly prevent, such collapses.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106521","World Development","Food security; Adaptability; Psychological resilience; Food systems; Resilience (materials science); Food insecurity; Business; Economics; Development economics; Geography; Agriculture; Psychology; Social psychology; Physics; Management; Archaeology; Thermodynamics","en",12,"http://agritrop.cirad.fr/607764/1/WorldDev2024FoodSystemConflicts.pdf",3540,"Examined how armed conflict in Burkina Faso disrupted food systems using empirical data from local food traders in Sebba.","Food trade contracted by 40–50%, with resilience failing to prevent a tenfold increase in local food insecurity.","Develop early-warning systems and trader support mechanisms to prevent total collapse of food systems in conflict zones.","Food insecurity",NA

Specifically, we explore whether the second generation’s level of schooling is negatively impacted by their parents’ malnutrition in utero, using the China Famine as a natural experiment. We find that, the impact of mother’s in utero malnutrition due to the Famine reduced second generation male and female entrance into junior secondary school by about 5–7 percentage points. We measure famine severity with provincial excess death rates instrumented by measures of adverse climate conditions, which corrects for possible biases induced by measurement errors and omitted variables.

"297","Infrastructure and household poverty in Brazil: A regional approach using multilevel models","Victor Medeiros; Rafael Saulo Marques Ribeiro; Pedro Amaral",2021,"Abstract Many scholars have highlighted the role of infrastructure investments in promoting economic growth along with poverty reduction and social inclusion. Developing economies show substantial discrepancies in terms of infrastructure in the rural–urban, regional and income dimensions. These disparities may be reinforcing a social and economic framework marked by a large portion of the population living in poverty. In a scenario characterized by immense regional and income heterogeneities, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of infrastructure investments on household poverty in Brazil. In addition, we verify whether these effects vary according to infrastructure characteristics such as provision, quality and access. The analysis is based on detailed household microdata from the Demographic Census and infrastructure variables at the municipal and state levels, captured from a variety of data sources. An additional contribution of the paper is the novel application of multilevel logistic models to investigate the relationship between infrastructure and poverty at household, municipal and state levels. Our results demonstrate negative effects of the infrastructure provision on poverty. These effects, in turn, are strengthened when infrastructure quality and access are greater, which allows us to infer about the importance of public policies aimed at achieving lower inequalities in access to basic sanitation, Internet, transportation, telephone services and electricity. These policies should also take into account the infrastructure heterogeneities at the regional level, since such heterogeneities have been important in explaining household poverty.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105118","World Development","Public economics; Public policy; Business; Poverty; Sanitation; Population; Microdata (HTML); Inequality; Multilevel model; Developing country","en",55,"https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:cdp:texdis:TD607",3552,"Used multilevel models to examine how infrastructure quality and access influence household poverty in Brazil.","Better infrastructure significantly reduced poverty, especially when quality and access were high.","Prioritize high-quality infrastructure investments in underserved regions to reduce household poverty.","Child poverty",NA

The economic and health system frameworks employed in CBHI policy have not sufficiently taken into account contextual considerations. Social capital theories could contribute to understanding why generally CBHI does not achieve significant and sustainable levels of population coverage. A framework of social capital and economic development is used to organize and interpret existing evidence on CBHI. This suggests that solidarity, trust, extra-community networks, vertical civil society links, and state–society relations affect the success of CBHI. Aligning schemes to “social determinants” of CBHI could result in structures that differ from those proposed by current analytic frameworks.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.04.018","World Development","Conceptual framework; Health care; Economics; Solidarity; Population; Economic growth; Civil society; Social capital; Social determinants of health; Developing country","en",77,"https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/13183/",3557,"Proposed a conceptual framework for community-based health insurance based on social capital and economic development in low-income countries.","CBHI success depends on solidarity, trust, networks, and state–society relations beyond economic factors alone.","Redesign health insurance schemes to align with social structures and improve income-related health access.","Income poverty","community-based health insurance; social capital; trust; health system; NGOs; local government"

Imai; Thankom Arun; Samuel Kobina Annim",2010,"The objective of the present study is to examine whether household access to microfinance reduces poverty. Using national household data from India, treatment effects model is employed to estimate the poverty-reducing effects of Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) loans for productive purposes, such as investment in agriculture or non-farm businesses on household poverty levels. These models take into account the endogenous binary treatment effects and sample selection bias associated with access to MFIs. Despite some limitations, such as those arising from potential unobservable important determinants of access to MFIs, significant positive effect of MFI productive loans on multidimensional welfare indicator has been confirmed. The significance of “treatment effects” coefficients has been verified by both Tobit and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) models. In addition, we found that loans for productive purposes were more important for poverty reduction in rural than in urban areas. However in urban areas, simple access to MFIs has larger average poverty-reducing effects than the access to loans from MFIs for productive purposes. This leads to exploring service delivery opportunities that provide an additional avenue to monitor the usage of loans to enhance the outreach.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.04.006","World Development","Public economics; Welfare; Rural area; Economics; Tobit model; Poverty; Investment (macroeconomics); Microfinance; Selection bias; Economic growth; Service delivery framework","en",309,"http://core.ac.uk/display/7432855",3558,"Estimated the poverty-reducing effects of microfinance loans for productive use in rural and urban India using national survey data.","Productive loans significantly improved multidimensional welfare, especially in rural areas.","Expand monitoring and outreach of productive microfinance services to maximize poverty reduction across regions.","Financial inclusion","Microfinance; Poverty; Evaluation; India; Propensity Score Matching JEL Classification: C21; I30; I38; O16; R51"

Conceptually, the paper builds on an asset-based approach to poverty and tests empirically, with household panel data, for the existence of a poverty trap. Findings indicate that there is little differentiation in productive asset endowments over time and that rural households gravitate towards a single equilibrium, which is at a surprisingly low level. The analysis shows that shocks and household coping behavior help to explain the observed poverty dynamics. The single low-level equilibrium points to an overall development trap in the rural farm-based economy. This is attributed to the longterm impact of the civil war, which has consolidated unfavorable economic conditions in rural areas and limited new economic opportunities outside of the agricultural sector.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.04.002","World Development","Welfare; Agriculture; Rural area; Economics; Poverty; Asset (economics); Poverty trap; Coping behavior; Development economics; Panel data","en; de",103,"https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeewdevel/v_3a40_3ay_3a2012_3ai_3a8_3ap_3a1594-1609.htm",3559,"Analyzed household asset dynamics and poverty traps in rural Mozambique using panel data post-civil war.","Households converge toward a low-equilibrium poverty trap due to shocks and limited economic opportunity.","Implement long-term rural development strategies to break persistent poverty traps in post-conflict zones.","Social protection","poverty trap; shocks; asset-based approach; violent conflict; Mozambique JEL Code: D31; I32; O12; O18 Poverty Traps; Asset Dynamics; and Shocks"

"302","The effects of violent conflict on household resilience and food security: Evidence from the 2014 Gaza conflict","Tilman Brück; Marco d’Errico; Rebecca Pietrelli",2019,"This paper studies how conflict affects household resilience capacity and food security, drawing on panel data collected from households in Palestine before and after the 2014 Gaza conflict. During this escalation of violence, the majority of the damages in the Gaza Strip were concentrated close to the Israeli border. Using the distance to the Israeli border to identify the effect of the conflict at the household level through an instrumental variable approach, we find that the food security of households in the Gaza Strip was not directly affected by the conflict. However, household resilience capacity that is necessary to resist food insecurity declined among Gazan households as a result of the conflict. This was mainly due to a reduction of adaptive capacity, driven by the deterioration of income stability and income diversification. However, the conflict actually increased the use of social safety nets (expressed in the form of cash, in-kind or other transfers that were received by the households) and access to basic services (mainly access to sanitation) for the households exposed to the conflict. This finding may be related to the support provided to households in the Gaza Strip by national and international organizations after the end of the conflict. From a policy perspective, the case of the conflict in the Gaza Strip demonstrates that immediate and significant support to victims of conflict can indeed help restore resilience capacity.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.008","World Development","Psychological resilience; Business; Instrumental variable; Adaptive capacity; Damages; Cash; Sanitation; Development economics; Food security; Panel data","en",143,"https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:119:y:2019:i:c:p:203-223",3562,"Used pre- and post-conflict panel data from Gaza to evaluate the 2014 conflict's impact on food security and resilience.","While food security levels held steady, household resilience declined due to reduced income stability and diversification.","Strengthen adaptive capacity and income sources to bolster food system resilience during armed conflicts.","Food insecurity","resilience; food security; conflict; Gaza Strip.

"303","Beyond Agriculture Versus Non-Agriculture: Decomposing Sectoral Growth–Poverty Linkages in Five African Countries","Paul A. Dorosh; James Thurlow",2018,"Summary Africa’s development debate is often cast as “agriculture versus non-agriculture”, with agriculture’s proponents arguing that agricultural growth is more effective at reducing poverty. This “dual economy” perspective overlooks the heterogeneity within and synergies between these two broad sectors. Recent studies decompose agriculture into subsectors and find that agricultural growth led by smallholder farmers is even more effective at reducing poverty than larger-scale estate farms. In contrast, few studies estimate subsectoral growth–poverty linkages for non-agriculture. Yet we strongly expect, for example, that growth led by informal traders or foreign-owned mining companies will have quite different implications for poverty reduction. Different perspectives on what constitutes “non-agriculture” might therefore explain divergent views on its relative importance for poverty reduction. To address this gap in our understanding, we estimate sectoral poverty–growth elasticities using economy-wide models for five African countries. While our estimated elasticities are higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture as a whole, the extent to which this is true varies considerably across nonagricultural subsectors (and across countries). We find that the poverty–growth elasticities for trade and transport services and manufacturing, especially agro-processing, are often close to, and sometimes exceed, agriculture’s. This means that growth led by these nonagricultural subsectors might be as effective as agriculture at reaching the poor. This confirms the need for a more nuanced treatment of non-agriculture in Africa’s policy debate, and may explain conflicting perspectives on agriculture’s role vis-a-vis non-agriculture.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.08.014","World Development","Agriculture; Economics; Poverty; Dual economy; Estate; Poverty reduction; Development economics","en",77,"https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/3596345c-116a-3599-b833-c03052d6302a/",3567,"Estimated growth–poverty elasticities across agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in five African countries using economy-wide models.","Trade, transport, and agro-processing sectors can be as effective as agriculture in reducing poverty.","Broaden poverty strategies to include non-agricultural sectors with high potential for inclusive growth.","Income poverty","economic growth; poverty reduction; agriculture; nonagriculture; Africa v"

Pursuant to the suggestion of participants in a recent participatory poverty assessment, this paper analyzes what might be termed the class structure of poverty. After exploring the range of claiming systems and livelihood tactics available in rural South Africa, the paper offers a first look at who the poor are by disaggregating the rural population into discrete livelihood strategy classes. Non-parametric regression methods are used to then estimate and graphically explore the nature of the livelihood mapping between endowments and real incomes. In addition to identifying those endowment combinations that map to consumption levels below the poverty line (the asset basis of poverty), the topography of the estimated livelihood mapping helps identify the constraints that limit household's ability to effectively utilize their assets and endowments. These results suggest that poverty is a matter of not only having few assets, but also of constraints which limit the effectiveness with which those assets are used, and poverty and livelihood policy needs to be designed accordingly.","10.1016/s0305-750x(98)00129-6","World Development","Social class; Consumption (economics); Standard of living; Endowment; Economics; Poverty; Asset (economics); Rural poverty; Livelihood; Development economics","en",322,"https://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/sps/pdf/stpap408.pdf",3569,"Mapped poverty and livelihoods in rural South Africa using national living standards survey data from 1993.","Asset constraints and poor returns on endowments both limit income and perpetuate poverty.","Target poverty policies to overcome both asset gaps and structural livelihood constraints.","Income poverty",NA

Levine; Ranjiv Khush; Rachel Peletz",2019,"Abstract Most residents of the developing world do not have access to safely managed sanitation services, and large financial investments are required to address this need. Here we evaluate surcharges on water/sewerage tariffs as an option for supporting these investments in low-income neighborhoods. We investigated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a pro-poor sanitation surcharge among customers of two urban water utilities in Kenya. Applying qualitative and quantitative methods, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews, focus-group discussions, and a double-bounded contingent valuation method for measuring WTP. We varied scenarios quasi-experimentally to study the effects of messaging and surcharge characteristics and evaluated factors associated with WTP. Our study finds that mean WTP was 290 KES (USD 2.9) per month, about 8% of the average water bill; median WTP was 100 KES (USD 1). In a multivariate analysis, WTP was significantly higher among customers that were younger, wealthier, shared toilets, and had higher water bills. WTP was also higher among customers that trusted the utility and distrusted the county government. Of our randomized scenarios, only the bill type was found to significantly influence WTP; WTP was higher if the surcharge was presented as a proportion of the customers’ last water bill vs a flat amount. Our findings suggest that in a sector that struggles to provide universal access to sanitation services, cross-subsidies may offer a means to support financing of safe sanitation for low-income households. These results indicate there are opportunities for cross-subsidies in urban Kenya that may be relevant for a wider understanding of surcharge payments that support basic services for low-income citizens.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.11.006","World Development","Business; Payment; Sewerage; Human settlement; Willingness to pay; Contingent valuation; Improved sanitation; Sanitation; Agricultural economics; Developing country","en",43,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v115y2019icp160-177.html",3572,"Assessed Kenyan urban water customers’ willingness to pay sanitation surcharges to finance services in low-income areas.","Many were willing to pay more when charges were proportional to their water bills, especially younger, wealthier users.","Implement tiered surcharge systems to fund equitable sanitation services in urban low-income communities.","Income poverty",NA

"312","Lives and livelihoods: Estimates of the global mortality and poverty effects of the Covid-19 pandemic","Benoit Decerf; Francisco H. G. Ferreira; Daniel Gerszon Mahler; Olivier Sterck",2021,"We evaluate the global welfare consequences of increases in mortality and poverty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Increases in mortality are measured in terms of the number of years of life lost (LY) to the pandemic. Additional years spent in poverty (PY) are conservatively estimated using growth estimates for 2020 and two different scenarios for its distributional characteristics. Using years of life as a welfare metric yields a single parameter that captures the underlying trade-off between lives and livelihoods: how many PYs have the same welfare cost as one LY. Taking an agnostic view of this parameter, we compare estimates of LYs and PYs across countries for different scenarios. Three main findings arise. First, we estimate that, as of early June 2020, the pandemic (and the observed private and policy responses) had generated at least 68 million additional poverty years and 4.3 million years of life lost across 150 countries. The ratio of PYs to LYs is very large in most countries, suggesting that the poverty consequences of the crisis are of paramount importance. Second, this ratio declines systematically with GDP per capita: poverty accounts for a much greater share of the welfare costs in poorer countries.

"313","Local Institutions, Poverty, and Household Welfare in Bolivia - Local Institutions, Poverty and Household Welfare in Bolivia","Christiaan Narayan Grootaert",2004,"The authors empirically estimate the impact of social capital on household welfare in Bolivia--where they found 67 different types of local associations. They focus on household memberships in local associations as being especially relevant to daily decisions that affect household welfare and consumption. On average, households belong to 1.4 groups and associations: 62 percent belong to agrarian syndicates, 16 percent to production groups, 13 percent to social service groups, and 10 percent to education and health groups. Smaller numbers belong to religious and government groups. Agrarian syndicates, created by government decree in 1952, are now viewed mainly as community-initiated institutions to manage conmunal resources. They have been registered as legal entities to work closely with municipalities to represent the interests and priorities of local people in municipal decisionmaking. The effects of social capital operate through (at least) three mechanisms: sharing of information among association members; the reduction of opportunistic behavior; and better collective decisionmaking. The effect of social capital on household welfare was found to be 2.5 times that of human capital. Increasing the average educational endowment of each adult in the household by one year (about a 2.5-percent increase) would increase per capita household spending 4.2 percent; a similar increase in the social capital endowment would increase spending 9 to 10.5 percent. They measured social capital along six dimensions: density of memberships, internal heterogeneity of associations (by gender, age, education, religion, etc.), meeting attendance, active participation in decisionmaking, payment of dues (in cash and in kind), and community orientation. The strongest effect came from number of memberships. Active membership in an agrarian syndicate is associated with an average 11.5 percent increase in household spending. Membership in another local association is associated with a 5.3-percent higher spending level. Empirical results partly confirm the hypothesis that social capital provides long-term benefits such as better access to credit and a higher level of trust in the community as a source of assistance in case of need.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.02.001","World Development","Welfare; Per capita; Business; Agrarian society; Social work; Social change; Human capital; Agrarian reform; Demographic economics; Social capital","zh_chs; en",135,"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/19594/1/multi0page.pdf",3594,"Used household data to estimate how local association membership (social capital) affects welfare in Bolivia.","Social capital had a stronger effect on spending than education, with syndicate members seeing up to 11.5% higher consumption.","Strengthen local associations to boost household welfare through community-driven social protection.","Social protection",NA

A natural choice would be to adopt a fully nonparametric specification of the relationship in order to let the data reveal its nonlinearity. But, we would be faced with the problem of the curse of dimensionality due to the presence of many control variables in addition to income. Here, we first propose to estimate generalized additive models where only income is supposed to enter nonlinearly in the specification. Second, we use a recent cross-validation procedure in order to choose among various competing specifications including the parametric double-log specification widely used in the literature in addition to GAM specifications. This methodology is implemented for each of the six waves of the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey from 2004 to 2014. The calorie-income relationship is nonlinear whatever the wave. A strong response of calorie intake to an increase in income for poorest households is highlighted, showing that there is still room for income-based policies to fight against malnutrition. A byproduct of this methodology is the decomposition of the evolution of average calorie intake between the two waves in the part due to population change and that coming from the change in calorie-income relationship, shedding new light on the nutritional transition in Vietnam.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.030","World Development","Nonparametric statistics; Parametric statistics; Econometrics; Control variable; Economics; Order (exchange); Generalized additive model; Malnutrition; Population growth; Estimation","en",25,"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02628994v1",3598,"Applied generalized additive models to six waves of Vietnamese household survey data to assess the calorie-income relationship.","Calorie intake responded strongly to income gains among the poorest, confirming a nonlinear pattern.","Target income-based nutrition programs to efficiently combat malnutrition in low-income populations.","Food insecurity","Calorie-income relationship; Generalized additive model; decomposition methods; nutritional transition; Vietnam"
"316","Climate and poverty in Africa South of the Sahara.","Carlo Azzarri; Sara Signorelli",2020,"To estimate the effects of weather conditions on welfare globally, cross-country comparisons need to rely on international poverty lines and comparable data sources at the micro-level. To this end, nationally representative household surveys can offer a useful instrument, also at the sub-national level. This study seeks to expand the existing knowledge on the determinants of poverty in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA), examining how long-term climatic conditions and year-specific weather shocks affect expenditure per capita. We take advantage of a novel and unique dataset combining consumption-based household surveys for 24 SSA countries -representative of more than half of the African population and two thirds of SSA- and geospatial information on agro-climatic conditions, market access and other spatial covariates of poverty. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a welfare-based, multidisciplinary, micro-level dataset with such wide spatial coverage has been assembled and examined. Our analysis relies on a linear and spatial model at the household- and district-level, respectively, both controlling for socio-economic, demographic, and geographic confounding factors. Results are consistent across econometric approaches, showing that living in more humid areas is positively associated with welfare, while the opposite occurs living in hotter areas, as existing literature shows. Flood shocks -defined as annual rainfall higher than one standard deviation from the 50-year average- are associated to a 35% decrease in total and food per-capita consumption and 17 percentage point increase in extreme poverty. On the other hand, extreme shortages of rain and heat shocks show an uncertain effect, even when estimates control for spatial correlation between welfare and weather conditions using the spatial error correction model. Given the heterogeneous effects of climatic events across SSA macro-regions, local-specific adaptation and mitigation strategies are suggested to help bringing households on a sustainable path.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104691","World development","Welfare; Per capita; Climate change; Consumption (economics); Econometrics; Poverty; Geography; Market access; Extreme poverty; Geospatial analysis","en",107,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6853414",3603,"Linked household survey data and geospatial climate information to assess climate impacts on poverty across 24 SSA countries.","Floods reduced consumption by 35% and increased extreme poverty by 17 percentage points, while heat and drought effects were mixed.","Design localized adaptation policies to protect poor households from region-specific climate shocks.","Social protection","Climate change; Mapping; Poverty; Spatial models; Sub-Saharan Africa; Weather shocks"

Current interpretations of the spread of social transfers in sub-Saharan Africa tend to emphasize the influence of elections and donor pressure, often by drawing correlations from statistical data, and focusing on the moment of programme adoption. This study adopts a different approach that traces the actual process through which countries have not just adopted but institutionalized social transfers. We test a new theoretical framework through within and cross-case analysis of the degree to which social protection programmes have become institutionalized in eight African countries. Two main pathways emerge: the first confirms the sense that both donors and elections matter, but goes further in showing the particular ways in which these drivers combine. In particular, transnational policy coalitions tend to play a leading role in adoption, whereas governments pursue the further institutionalization of social transfers as a top-down response to competitive elections. However, we also identify an alternative pathway that involves electorally uncompetitive countries; here, the primary motivation is not elections but elite perceptions of vulnerability in the face of distributional crises, augmented by ideas and resources from transnational policy coalitions. Consequently, the latest phase of social transfer development results from the interplay of political survival strategies and transnational policy coalitions.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105549","World Development","Political economy; Institutionalisation; Political science; Phase (combat); Vulnerability; Perception; Elite; Social protection; Face (sociological concept); Politics","en",25,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v146y2021ics0305750x21001649.html",3612,"Analyzed the institutionalization process of social transfer programs in eight sub-Saharan African countries using within and cross-case methods.","Two pathways emerged—one driven by elections and donors, and another by elite political survival strategies supported by transnational coalitions.","Support long-term institutionalization of social protection by aligning donor support with national political incentives.","Social protection",NA
"319","Informality, property rights, and poverty in China’s “favelas”","Chris Webster; Fulong Wu; Fangzhu Zhang; Chinmoy Sarkar",2016,"In this study of households living in informal settlements in three principal Chinese cities, we analyze the associations between informality, property rights, and poverty. We propose that informality can be understood in terms of property rights (presence/absence, strength, completeness, and ambiguity). Drawing on the property rights (entitlements) theories of Sen, de Soto, Ostrom, Alchian, and Coase, we refine a list of property rights effects that can be tested empirically. Using a household questionnaire survey of 1,208 respondents from a representative sample of 60 urban villages in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, we use robust regression models to detect statistical relationships between household performance on six poverty domains as a function of four property rights domains, controlling for income, human capital, and other influences. We find evidence for what we call Sen effects and de Soto effects. Our models show that some property rights are associated with lower poverty indicators. But we also find evidence to show that the absence, weakness, or ambiguity of property rights also reduce poverty indicators on particular domains, through what we assume to be a substitution effect. Informal settlements permit poorer household to live at lower costs than is usually, or officially, acceptable, and thus spend more on other welfare-enhancing expenditures. The distribution of property rights determines the size, distribution, and impacts of these trade-offs and shapes the economic and social performance of informal settlements.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.007","World Development","Corporate social responsibility; Economics; Poverty; Poverty in China; Human capital; Beijing; Ambiguity; Demographic economics; Development economics; Coase theorem; Property rights","en",68,"https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:eee:wdevel:v:78:y:2016:i:C:p:461-476",3615,"Surveyed 1,208 households in urban Chinese informal settlements to assess how property rights relate to multiple poverty indicators.","Strong property rights reduced some poverty measures, but informal housing also helped households lower living costs and redirect spending.","Formalize secure but flexible property arrangements to balance housing affordability and poverty alleviation in urban areas.","Urban poverty","chengzhongcun; slums; urban poverty; Sen; de Soto; property rights"
"320","Unconditional Cash Transfers in China: Who Benefits from the Rural Minimum Living Standard Guarantee (Dibao) Program?","Jennifer Golan; Terry Sicular; Nithin Umapathi",2017,"Summary This paper analyzes China’s rural minimum living standard guarantee (dibao) program, one of the largest minimum income cash transfer schemes in the world, and examines possible changes to the program design. Despite its size and central position in China’s current poverty reduction strategy, little is known about the rural dibao program’s performance and targeting effectiveness. Our analysis uses annual household survey data from the China Household Income Project matched with published administrative data for the years 2007–09. We find that the program provides sufficient income to poor beneficiaries but does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty. Conventional targeting analysis reveals large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting errors; propensity score targeting analysis yields smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of possible changes to the program design reveal that expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty reduction than increasing transfer amounts. Replacing locally diverse dibao lines and transfer amounts with a nationally uniform dibao threshold and transfer could in theory reduce poverty further, but the potential gains are modest without improvements in targeting. This paper makes several contributions. To our knowledge this is the first household-level empirical analysis of China’s dibao program in rural areas, so the findings provide new, policy-relevant information. Moreover, the literature has not settled the question of whether such programs should be centralized or decentralized. We show that in practice the potential gains of centralizing the eligibility rule and transfer amount are conditional on the efficiency of targeting. By varying the program’s key design parameters our analysis also yields insights into alternative policy recommendations to improve the program performance.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.011","World Development","Public economics; Per capita income; Economics; Poverty; Poverty threshold; Rural poverty; Cash transfers; Poverty gap index; Household income; Extreme poverty","en",80,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v93y2017icp316-336.html",3616,"Used household survey data (2007–09) to evaluate China’s rural Dibao cash transfer program's targeting and impact.","While Dibao provides adequate income to recipients, targeting errors limit its overall poverty-reduction effectiveness.","Improve targeting accuracy and consider expanding coverage to strengthen China’s rural safety net.","Social protection",NA

Khatri; Pushpendra Rana",2021,"Abstract The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to lives and livelihoods around the world. These disruptions have brought into sharp focus experiences of vulnerability but also, at times, evidence of resilience as people and institutions gear up to respond to the crisis. Drawing on intensive qualitative enquiry in 16 villages of Himalayan India and Nepal, this paper documents both dark and bright spots from the early days of the pandemic. We find intense experiences of fear and uncertainty, heightened food insecurity, and drastic reductions in livelihood opportunities. However, we also find a wide range of individual and collective responses as well as a patchwork of policy support mechanisms that have provided at least some measure of basic security. Local elected governments have played a critical role in coordinating responses and delivering social support, however the nature of their actions varies as a result of different institutional arrangements and state support systems in the two countries. Our findings highlight the changing nature of vulnerability in the present era, as demographic shifts, growing off-farm employment and dependence on remittances, and increasing market integration have all brought about new kinds of exposure to risk for rural populations in the context of the present disruption and beyond. Most importantly, our research shows the critical importance of strong systems of state support for protecting basic well-being in times of crises. Based on these findings, we argue that there is a need for greater knowledge of how local institutions work in tandem with a broader set of state support mechanisms to generate responses for urgent challenges; such knowledge holds the potential to develop governance systems that are better able to confront diverse shocks that households face, both now and in the future.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105370","World development","Shadow (psychology); Psychological resilience; Political science; Vulnerability; Social vulnerability; Context (language use); Market integration; Livelihood; Development economics; Food security","en",38,"https://eprints.exchange.isb.edu/id/eprint/1412/",3621,"Conducted qualitative research in 16 Himalayan villages to examine rural vulnerability and local governance during COVID-19.","Households faced food insecurity and lost livelihoods, but local governance played a key role in delivering uneven support.","Invest in resilient local institutions to better coordinate crisis responses in rural settings.","Rural poverty","COVID-19; Food security; India; Local governance; Nepal; Rural livelihoods; Uncertainty; Vulnerability"

Tambo; Bellancile Uzayisenga; Idah Mugambi; Mary Bundi; Silvia Silvestri",2020,"Abstract An estimated 40% of potential global crop production is lost annually to pests and diseases. Reducing this level of crop loss is critical to increasing agricultural productivity, which is essential in achieving the sustainable development goals of zero hunger and no poverty. However, the lack of access to timely and relevant advice on crop health problems poses a significant challenge to farmers to take action at the right time to mitigate crop losses. In efforts to address this issue, over 4000 plant clinics have been established in 34 countries worldwide where farmers who are struggling with plant pests and diseases can take samples of their ‘sick’ crops to trained plant doctors for diagnosis and plant health advice. The plant clinic initiative began in 2003, but thus far, there has not been a rigorous assessment of the impact of this innovative approach of delivering targeted agricultural extension services. Using a recent panel survey of smallholder maize producers in rural Rwanda, this paper attempts to address this gap by analysing the impact of plant clinics on farm performance (measured by technology adoption, and maize yield and income) and on poverty alleviation (measured by the Progress out of Poverty Index). Employing the correlated random effects estimation methods to account for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that plant clinics significantly increase the adoption of crop protection technologies to control devastating maize pests, such as fall armyworm and maize stalk borer, and this, in turn, results in significant maize yield and net income gains of 28% and 23%, respectively. We also show that seeking plant health advice from plant clinics is significantly associated with a 5% reduction in the likelihood of a household falling below the extreme poverty line of $1.25 per day. The results imply that policies and programmes aimed at promoting the establishment of and farmers’ participation in plant clinics can contribute to increased agricultural productivity and poverty reduction.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104881","World Development","Impact assessment; Agricultural productivity; Net income; Business; Poverty; Agricultural extension; Agricultural economics; Crop protection; Sustainable development; Extreme poverty","en",25,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v129y2020ics0305750x20300073.html",3624,"Used panel survey data to assess how plant clinics affect maize yields and poverty among smallholder farmers in Rwanda.","Plant clinic use raised maize yields by 28%, income by 23%, and reduced extreme poverty likelihood by 5%.","Scale up plant clinic services to improve agricultural productivity and reduce poverty among rural farmers.","Housing insecurity; Intersectional poverty",NA

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation.

Sidze; Hermann Pythagore Pierre Donfouet; Amanuel Abajobir",2021,"This research assesses how low-income households in rural Kenya coped with the immediate economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses granular financial data from weekly household interviews covering six weeks before the first case was detected in Kenya to five weeks after during which various containment measures were implemented. Based on household-level fixed-effects regressions, our results suggest that income from work decreased with almost one-third and income from gifts and remittances reduced by more than one-third after the start of the pandemic. Nevertheless, household expenditures on food remained at pre-COVID levels. We do not find evidence that households coped with reduced income through increased borrowing, selling assets or withdrawing savings. Instead, they gave out less gifts and remittances themselves, lent less money to others and postponed loan repayments. Moreover, they significantly reduced expenditures on schooling and transportation, in line with the school closures and travel restrictions. Thus, despite their affected livelihoods, households managed to keep food expenditures at par, but this came at the cost of reduced informal risk-sharing and social support between households.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105280","World Development","Finance; Business; Work (electrical); Loan; Social support; Economic consequences; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Low income; Livelihood; Term (time)","en; fr",112,"https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03127774v1",3638,"Analyzed weekly financial data from rural Kenyan households before and after COVID-19 onset.","Household income dropped by one-third, but food spending remained steady by cutting non-essential expenditures and social transfers.","Support informal safety nets and essential services to help low-income households absorb future economic shocks.","Income poverty",NA
"330","Using Facebook ad data to track the global digital gender gap","Masoomali Fatehkia; Ridhi Kashyap; Ingmar Weber",2018,"Abstract Gender equality in access to the internet and mobile phones has become increasingly recognised as a development goal. Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace ‘big data’ – Facebook’s advertisement audience estimates – that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform’s over 2 billion users to measure and ‘nowcast’ digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining ‘online’ indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, ‘offline’ indicators related to a country’s overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.007","World Development","Internet privacy; The Internet; Official statistics; Mobile phone; Aggregate data; Predictive power; Context (language use); Online and offline; Computer science; Big data","en",125,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18300883",3640,"Used Facebook ad audience data to estimate digital gender gaps in mobile and internet access across countries.","Facebook indicators closely matched official gender gap data, especially in countries with limited statistics.","Leverage real-time digital data to monitor and reduce the gender digital divide in low-income countries.","Income poverty",NA
"331","Reaching the Poor: Cash Transfer Program Targeting in Cameroon","Quentin Stoeffler; Bradford F. Mills; Carlo del Ninno",2016,"Identifying and selecting poor households with efficient targeting methods is essential for effective poverty alleviation programs. This paper assesses the ex-post performance of two popular targeting mechanisms, Proxy Means Testing (PMT) and Community-Based Targeting (CBT), in a pilot cash transfer program in Cameroon. Several indicators and metrics to measure each method’s performance in terms of inclusion of poor households and exclusion of non-poor households are employed. Results consistently show that CBT performs poorly in terms of selecting households with low per capita consumption when compared to PMT. CBT appears to select households with low physical and human capital, regardless of actual consumption level. However, CBT also shows more variability in the selection decision than PMT even when alternative poverty definitions are used as robustness tests. The PMT method used in the pilot slightly outperforms other targeting methods (hybrid, alternative PMT, and universal targeting with equal budget), but errors remain high when selecting 35% of the population for program participation. The results suggest caution is needed in employing CBT methods to select households with low per capita consumption in an environment where poverty levels are high and administrative capacities are limited. CBT performance may be improved through more uniform and consistent guidance on program selection criteria and process, including explicit criteria that enable CBT monitoring, as well as a better integration between PMT and CBT.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.01.012","World Development","Per capita; Consumption (economics); Econometrics; Economics; Poverty; Operations management; Human capital; Cash; Robustness (economics); Cash transfers; Population","en",47,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16000103",3642,"Evaluated the targeting accuracy of Proxy Means Testing (PMT) versus Community-Based Targeting (CBT) in a pilot cash transfer program in Cameroon.","PMT outperformed CBT in identifying low-consumption households, while CBT showed inconsistent selection based on physical and human capital.","Integrate and strengthen PMT methods to improve accuracy and accountability in social protection targeting.","Housing insecurity; Social protection",NA

However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104746","World Development","Scarcity; Deforestation; Business; Natural resource economics; Economic impact analysis; Poverty; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; Climate change mitigation; Sustainable development; Sustainability","en",95,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v127y2020ics0305750x1930395x.html",3649,"Synthesized data from multinational, Malaysian, and Indonesian studies to examine how poverty and agricultural rents drive deforestation.","High poverty and agricultural rents accelerate forest loss, but poverty reduction policies can slow deforestation sustainably.","Prioritize poverty alleviation in climate policy to achieve long-term reductions in tropical deforestation.","Climate vulnerability; Social protection",NA

Hobbes; W.T. de Groot; E. van der Voet; Sukanya Sarkhel",2011,"Summary This paper develops, tests, and discusses a metric for livelihood assessment that integrates cash flow and time use households. It expresses how much time the household adults have left after satisfying the household’s basic needs (e.g., for food, sleep, care, consumables, and leisure). This “freely disposable time” ( FDT ) may be put to any use available and allowed in the local context, such as above-basic leisure, work to acquire above-basic consumer goods, or investments in the future such as education or soil conservation. Thus, FDT represents people’s freedoms and a key condition for any out-of-poverty strategy. The FDT methodology is illustrated with a number of characteristic livelihood strategies and tested on peri-urban farming livelihoods in India and some typical Dutch households. The FDT outcomes, methodology, strengths, and limitations are compared with those of an allied, “Discretionary Time” indicator, paired time/money indicators and purely monetary (e.g., income or expenditure) indicators of poverty and welfare.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.04.005","World Development","Public economics; Welfare; Macroeconomics; Economics; Cash flow; Metric (unit); Time allocation; Poverty; Basic needs; Context (language use); Livelihood","en",12,"https://core.ac.uk/display/85404746",3653,"Developed and tested a ‘freely disposable time’ (FDT) metric to assess poverty by integrating time and income data.","FDT captures livelihood freedom better than traditional poverty metrics, reflecting real-world constraints on time use.","Adopt FDT as a complementary measure in poverty assessments to guide more holistic social protection strategies.","Social protection","livelihoods approach; poverty assessment; social indicator; basic needs; time poverty; poverty line; freedoms; discretionary time; India"

We find that, given a persistent gender division of labor, mass unemployment in the North is due to different forces operating on men and women. The rate of growth of men's jobs has fallen because of deindustrialization, but men have not withdrawn from the labor force at a comparable rate. Women have been entering the labor force in feminized jobs at a faster rate than they have been created. In the South, women have largely taken traditionally feminized jobs in the labor-intensive, export-oriented growing manufacturing sectors; in Latin America, entry has been largely in the service sector. Men have been losing jobs in agriculture and domestic manufacturing. The paper proposes that the optimal solution to the mass unemployment problem in the North, as well as in the South, and the apparent competition for jobs between the North and the South and between men and women lies in achieving a trend increase in the growth rate of OECD and world aggregate demand and output. But such a trend rise in the long-term rate of growth of demand would only be possible if there were new cooperative institutional arrangements within and between countries. In such arrangements women need to have an important, independent role.","10.1016/0305-750x(95)00096-u","World Development","Latin Americans; Economics; Aggregate demand; World economy; Unemployment; Deindustrialization; Demographic economics; Tertiary sector of the economy; Development economics; Developing country; Division of labour","en",27,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X9500096U",3655,"Analyzed gendered employment trends in global labor markets amid structural economic shifts in the North and South.","Women entered low-wage feminized jobs while men lost jobs in agriculture and industry, worsening unemployment.","Promote cooperative economic policies that support gender-inclusive job growth to address structural unemployment.","Employment",NA

Investigating theories of change processes in Myanmar","Tim Forsyth",2018,"Abstract Approaches to resilience to climate change can be socially exclusionary if they do not acknowledge diverse experiences of risks or socio-economic barriers to resilience. This paper contributes to analyses of resilience by studying how theories of change (ToC) processes used by development organizations might lead to social exclusions, and seeking ways to make these more inclusive. Adopting insights from participatory monitoring and evaluation, the paper first presents fieldwork from four villages in Myanmar to compare local experiences of risk and resilience with the ToCs underlying pathways to resilience based on building anticipatory, absorptive, and adaptive capacities. The paper then uses interviews with the development organizations using these pathways to identify how ToC processes might exclude local experiences and causes of risk, and to seek ways to make processes more inclusive. The research finds that development organizations can contribute to shared ToCs for resilience, but adopt tacitly different models of risk that reduce attention to more transformative socio-economic pathways to resilience. Consequently, there is a need to consider how resilience and ToCs can become insufficiently scrutinized boundary objects when they are shared by actors with different models of risk and intervention.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.023","World Development","Climate change; Sociology; Resilience (network); Participatory monitoring; Public relations; Livelihood; Intervention (law); Transformative learning; Theory of change; Adaptation (computer science)","en",54,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18302158",3665,"Studied how development organizations' theories of change shape social inclusion in climate resilience programs in Myanmar.","Organizations often adopt narrow models of risk, leading to the exclusion of local experiences in resilience-building.","Revise climate resilience planning to incorporate diverse local knowledge and reduce social exclusion.","Climate vulnerability",NA

To address these issues, the paper relies on a very rich data set, the Young Lives data, and use an original instrument that allow to cast light on the causal relation between aspiration and educational outcomes. We find that aspiration failure is a channel of inequality persistence between indigenous and non-indigenous people, but that aspiration failure do not takes the form of a lack of aspiration.

In the Latin American context, this holds especially for countries such as Costa Rica, which has one of the strongest social policy regimes in the South and the highest (Nicaraguan) immigrant stock in Latin America. Set in the context of Costa Rica, this paper assesses two views which seem hard to reconcile, and, are common in the country. First, it is claimed that Nicaraguan migrants use public health services disproportionately, thereby threatening the country’s welfare system. Second, pro-migrant rights non-governmental organizations and academics are concerned, primarily based on qualitative studies, that access to health services for Nicaraguan immigrants is limited, and that they are discriminated based on nationality. This paper relies on administrative data and a unique data set representative of Nicaraguan born individuals residing in Costa Rica to examine the validity of both these claims. We do not find support for either. The incidence of migrant health care use is lower than their share in the population and at the same time there is no evidence of discrimination in health care access for migrants based on their nationality.

Aker; Peter van der Windt; Maarten Voors",2020,"Abstract The work of Nobel Laureates Banerjee, Duflo and Kremer has centered around the use of randomized control trials to help solve development problems. To date, however, few field experiments have been undertaken to evaluate the effects of humanitarian assistance. The reasons may lie in challenges related to logistics, fragility, security and ethics that often loom large in humanitarian settings. Yet every year, billions of dollars are spent on humanitarian aid, and policymakers are in need of rigorous evidence. In this paper, we reflect on the opportunities and risks of running experiments in humanitarian settings, and provide, as illustration, insights from our experiences with recent field experiments of large-scale humanitarian aid programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104830","World Development","Work (electrical); Political science; Poverty; Field (Bourdieu); Public relations; Humanitarian aid; Democracy","en",7,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19304796",3703,"Reviewed the opportunities and limitations of using randomized field experiments in humanitarian aid settings.","Few RCTs exist in fragile settings due to ethical and logistical challenges, despite rising aid investments.","Invest in ethical and secure experimental evaluations to improve humanitarian program effectiveness.","Housing insecurity",NA

Grundy; Dan van der Horst; Casey M. Ryan",2019,"Abstract Forest and woodland resources can play a key role in rural livelihoods in the Global South, making it critical to understand what forest change could mean for rural wellbeing. Calculating environmental income has become a popular method of highlighting the importance of environmental resources in livelihoods, but few studies have quantified both provisioning ecosystem service availability and environmental income in the same landscape, or disaggregated environmental income by source land cover. This limits our ability to anticipate how forest change could impact rural livelihoods and could result in management interventions detrimental to vulnerable groups. The objective of this study was therefore to explore links between woodland cover, provisioning ecosystem service availability and household environmental income by applying a novel interdisciplinary approach in six villages on a gradient of woodland resource availability in Zimbabwe. We firstly use techniques from quantitative ethnobotany to score the species underpinning six locally important provisioning ecosystem services, and combine these scores with data from 80 tree survey plots to establish provisioning service availability. We then use income data from 91 households to explore relationships between provisioning service availability and household income portfolios. We find that villages with less woodland have lower availability of all studied ecosystem services and also a lower diversity of species underpinning service provision, but that there are no significant relationships between woodland resource availability and environmental income, livelihood diversity or intra-community income inequality in the case study area. We suggest that income portfolios are very resilient to woodland loss because households can still derive significant resources from woodlands which would be considered degraded in ecological terms and can draw upon kin networks which facilitate access to resources beyond village boundaries. The novel combination of approaches used in this study, particularly if applied at greater spatial and temporal scales, can provide valuable insight into the complexities of resource use in forest-agriculture mosaics.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.008","World Development","Resource (biology); Provisioning; Natural resource economics; Woodland; Geography; Household income; Livelihood; Service (economics); Economic inequality; Ecosystem services","en",36,"https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/96713428/1_s2.0_S0305750X19301226_main.pdf",3707,"Assessed how woodland availability affects environmental income and livelihoods in six Zimbabwean villages.","Households maintained environmental income even in degraded areas through adaptive resource use and kin networks.","Protect degraded woodlands and social networks that sustain rural income in ecologically fragile regions.","Rural poverty",NA

Rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture pegged down fish prices, resulting in increased fish consumption by extreme poor and moderate poor consumers and those in rural areas.

But scant, if any, evidence exists on gender gaps in economic outcomes such as income, expenditure, savings, and job loss in a multi-country setting. We investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on gender inequality in these outcomes using data from a six-country survey that covers countries in different geographical locations and at various income levels. Our findings suggest that women are 24 percent more likely to permanently lose their job than men because of the outbreak. Women also expect their labor income to fall by 50 percent more than men do. Perhaps because of these concerns, women tend to reduce their current consumption and increase savings. Factors such as the different participation rates in work industries for men and women may take an important part in explaining these gender gaps.

We then scrutinize the last three waves of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) to analyze the existence of the dual theorem. Our study uses Difference in Difference (DiD) regressions and ordered logit regressions to confirm that moving out of agriculture sectors has significantly increased the welfare of poor agricultural households, especially in the period of 2000-2007, but this is not the case of 2007-2014. Movement out of agricultural sectors decreases the probability of being always poor by 13.5 percentage points. However, when the economy transforms into a more advanced economy, simply moving out of agriculture does not guarantee that farmers, especially landless farmers, will become better off. Welfare improvement requires a shifting to formal non-agricultural sectors, but unfortunately farmers might not be readily equipped with the skills required in formal sectors. Our study also obviously confirms that farmland is an important asset for agricultural households. Agricultural households experiencing a decrease of agricultural land also decreased their expenditure per capita by IDR 36,833 in 2000 and IDR 68,683 in 2007. These findings suggest that, currently, moving out of agriculture is not the solution to improve the well-being of farmers.

We evaluate the impact of internal migration on both objective and subjective measures of well-being using a unique longitudinal study in rural Pakistan spanning 1991–2013. We account for selection using covariate matching. Migrants have roughly 35–40 percent higher consumption, yet are less likely to report being happy, calm and/or in excellent health, and more likely to report having been sick recently. Our results suggest that deteriorating physical health coupled with feelings of stress and relative deprivation underlie the disparity between objective and subjective well-being. Thus, despite substantial monetary gains from migration, people may be happier and less mentally distressed by remaining at home.

How do citizens in such political systems learn about elections and develop participatory orientations? Civil society organizations can promote political socialization, yet often fail to reach those lowest in resources. This article proposes that churches constitute an often overlooked instance of civil society, one that is highly inclusive and provides frequent opportunities for interaction. Such socialization can be especially important in low-income and low-education neighborhoods, where access to media and political information through everyday social networks is more limited. A case study of a municipal election campaign in a single Brazilian city reveals that exposure to political information in church is common, especially in evangelical churches and in low-education neighborhoods. Even more frequent than partisan discussion is promotion of non-partisan civic norms encouraging citizens to cast informed votes based on non-clientelistic criteria. Those exposed to civic and partisan messages know significantly more about the local campaign and are more likely to turn out. Messages encouraging a “conscientious vote” boost knowledge most strongly in low-education neighborhoods, helping to equalize political information across the urban environment. This suggests that development professionals take churches seriously as sites of civic education.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.032","World Development","Sociology; Voting behavior; Political socialization; Citizen journalism; Socialization; Context (language use); Public relations; Civil society; Democracy; Politics","en",38,"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v99y2017icp441-451.html",3772,"Studied the political socialization effect of churches during elections in low-income Brazilian neighborhoods.","Churchgoers received civic and partisan messages that increased turnout and informed voting, especially in underserved areas.","Leverage community-based institutions like churches for civic education in urban low-resource environments.","Urban poverty",NA

This paper exemplifies a new approach to the study of agricultural change: analyzing commercialization effects through a local concept of the Good Life. In our case study of East Nepal, we first elicited a local concept of the Good Life through qualitative interviews and participatory photography. In the analysis, we disaggregated the data between men and women, elderly and young, farmers and laborers as well as members of different castes. Second, we applied the resulting Good Life concept to the evaluation of agricultural commercialization. Our results show that the local concept of the Good Life is multidimensional and includes both subjectively and objectively measurable dimensions. Respondents across all socio-economic groups consistently emphasized the notion of hardship (dukha) in both their Good Life concepts and their perspectives on agricultural change. Commercialization was evaluated positively predominantly because it reduced physical and financial hardship, in addition to tangible improvements in other domains. However, respondents also pointed to the limitations of commercialization in contributing to the Good Life: the ultimate reduction of hardship was associated with the prospect of non-agricultural employment. The notion of hardship elicited through the perspectives of the Good Life offers a nuanced perspective on commercialization. Including local views in analyses of agricultural change enables researchers and policy makers alike to direct their efforts to those aspects of agricultural change that are most meaningful to the local population.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105410","World Development","Agriculture; Cash crop; Business; Citizen journalism; Perspective (graphical); Well-being; The good life; Face (sociological concept); Commercialization; Economic growth","en",12,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X2100022X",3784,"Used participatory methods to assess how agricultural commercialization affects well-being in eastern Nepal.","Commercialization reduced physical and financial hardship but did not fully meet local aspirations for the ‘Good Life.’","Align agricultural development with locally defined well-being goals to maximize impact on rural poverty.","Income poverty",NA

Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by “the perversity thesis”—a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from “poverty to perversity.” We use the term “ideational embeddedness” to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative.

Rapid population growth is therefore often blamed for economic stagnation in less developed countries. Others however believe that rapid labor force growth is good for the economy. The authors conducted a cross-national study of the economic growth rates of 75 developing countries in which the annual average percentage change in real gross domestic product per capita is regressed from 1965 to 1990 on demographic models which incorporate either total population growth rates and labor force growth rates or age-specific population growth rates. The study found that an increase in the child population impedes economic progress while an increase in the adult population fosters economic development. This phenomenon may be due to demographic transition which allows a massive one-time boost in economic development as rapid labor force growth occurs in the absence of large and growing youth dependency. There may also be a demographic ratchet effect in which economies remain stagnant during baby booms but grow rapidly as baby boomers age and assume economically productive roles in society.","10.2307/2657351","American Sociological Review","Population momentum; Per capita; Demographic transition; Economics; Economic stagnation; Real gross domestic product; Population; Economic growth; Population growth; Developing country","en",96,"https://www.popline.org/node/271871",250,"Assessed effects of age-specific population growth on economic development using GDP data from 75 developing countries (1965–1990).","Child population growth impeded economic progress, while adult population growth boosted development during demographic transitions.","Target youth investment and labor force integration under employment policy to harness demographic dividends.","Employment",NA

Among whites in the six cities there is no consistent relationship between migration status and being poor and on welfare, except for slightly higher than average rates of poverty and receipt of welfare among the Southern born.

Using data from the 1990 census and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, a hierarchical linear modeling approach is employed that allows the simultaneous exploration of the mechanisms of income inequality operating both within and between occupations. Among private-sector employees, striking evidence shows that racial disparities increase in both absolute and percentage terms as one moves up the occupational earnings hierarchy. The association between average occupational earnings and within-occupation racial disadvantage reveals an overlooked source of racial earnings inequality which constrains the opportunities available to upwardly mobile black men in the private sector. This association cannot be explained by measured individual characteristics, or by the status, demographic composition, or skill demands of occupations. In the public sector, on the other hand, racial inequality in earnings is not systematically associated with average occupational earnings, and is instead more closely tied to individual human capital and occupational placement. The implications of these results are considered and directions for future research are suggested.","10.2307/3088922","American Sociological Review","Private sector; Labour economics; Public sector; Economics; Human capital; Wage; Salary; Earnings; Inequality; Economic inequality","ru",304,"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/pager/files/asr_grodskypager.pdf",256,"Used 1990 Census data and occupational metrics to examine how the Black-white wage gap varies across occupational hierarchies in the U.S. private and public sectors.","In the private sector, racial wage disparities worsened with occupational prestige, while in the public sector, disparities were driven more by human capital than occupation rank.","Revise income poverty policies to address structural racial disadvantages in high-paying private sector jobs.","Income poverty",NA

It is my purpose to make a critical examination of some of the literature in this field and to suggest a different approach to the analysis of slum social life. Interest in the slums seems to have stemmed from two sources: (i) an urge to bring about social reforms, and (2) an effort to reach an understanding of the process of urbanization. The studies of Charles Booth' and B. Seebohm Rowntree' are representative of the reform interest. Being preoccupied with poverty and related problems, these men provided a mass of valuable data upon working class standards of living, but they had little to say about the social life of slum dwellers. The urbanization studies provide a closer approach to the analysis of social behavior in this area. The contrast between primitive or peasant society and the urban community has prompted many eminent social scientists to formulate theories upon the nature of social relations in the two environments.

What happens to the living conditions of the unemployed? When they lose their jobs, are they destitute? If so, does relief mitigate the situation so that they and their families can live with some decency? Is their standard of living reduced? What items suffer? Is their consumption, particularly of food, so reduced that they tend to lose their working efficiency? Some of these questions receive at least partial answers for a limited sample and district from the data presented in this paper. In fact, the value of the study lies as much in showing what information may be obtained by an investigation of this sort, as in the conclusions themselves. The families studied are part of the large unemployed population whom it was the aim of the relief administration to assist. They are families in Massachusetts whose chief wage earner had lost his regular job and had applied for relief. The Cambridge sample is, indeed, composed of 397 relief applicants who were on the A list of the Cambridge branch of the ERA. All of them had not yet received relief when the investigation took place, but they were considered urgently in need of relief. The unemployed families in the four small towns were all actually in receipt of relief. The Cambridge families were not, however, totally unemployed. In most cases, some member of the family had a job, usually temporary, the income from which was considered insufficient to support the family. The majority of the chief wage earners were day laborers or factory workers,' most of whom (6i%) had not gone beyond the eighth grade in school. Only 3% had gone beyond twelve years of schooling. The same was true of the homemakers, usually the wives; 67% had six to eight years of schooling, and 2% more than twelve. The average age of the chief wage earner was 40, that of the homemaker, 46.

"384","Fertility among women on welfare: incidence and determinants.","Mark R. Rank",1989,"Longitudinal caseload data of welfare recipients in the United States was used to calculate the fertility rate for women aged 18-44 in an effort to explore the incidence and determinants of fertility among women on welfare. These rates were compared (and standardized) with rates in the general population. A logistic regression analysis models the determinants of childbearing among women on welfare. 3 questions were addressed: what is the likelihood of childbearing among women on welfare; how do these rates compare with those of the general population; and what are the determinants of fertility among welfare recipients. During the 1st observed 6-month interval 1.89% of women on welfare gave birth. During the 6-12 month interval 2.74% gave birth. The percentage giving birth during any 6-month interval was relatively stable at approximately 2%. It was estimated that 4.58% of women will give birth during a 1-year interval. The overall fertility rate for women on welfare thus was 45.8. In addition 11.49% of women will bear children during a 3-year period on welfare. Based on data from the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services (1981) and the US Bureau of the Census (1981) the fertility rates in Wisconsin and the national population in 1980 per 1000 women aged 18-44 were 75.3 (Wisconsin) and 71.1 (national population). These rates were considerably higher than the 1-year fertility rate of 45.8 for women on welfare. Women on welfare had a substantially lower fertility rate than women in the general population. The fertility rates of women on welfare continued to be considerably below those of the national and Wisconsin populations when age children marital status race or education were standardized. Thus the lower overall fertility rate among women receiving public assistance programs was not an artifact of a more favorable demographic structure but was clearly lower even when major demographic compositional differences were considered. Several variables significantly affected the likelihood of childbearing among women on welfare: education; race; age; marital status; and length of welfare use. Women with less than 12 years of education were 32% more likely to have a child than women with 12 or more years of education; nonwhites had an 89% greater probability of giving birth than whites. The longer a woman remained on welfare the less likely she was to give birth.","10.2307/2095797","American Sociological Review","Welfare; Socioeconomic status; Demography; Marital status; Population; Birth rate; Total fertility rate; Fertility; Social Welfare; Medicine","en",65,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2095797.pdf",299,"Used welfare caseload data to assess fertility incidence and determinants among U.S. women aged 18–44 on public assistance.","Women on welfare had significantly lower fertility than the general population, influenced by race, education, marital status, and welfare duration.","Integrate fertility and family planning supports into social protection programs to address reproductive needs of welfare recipients.","Social protection",NA

"387","EMERGING PARENTAL GENDER INDIFFERENCE? SEX COMPOSITION OF CHILDREN AND THE THIRD BIRTH.","Michael S. Pollard; S. Philip Morgan",2002,"Along and fruitful sociological tradition links demographic differences and changes to institutional structure and change. For example, Durkheim’s ([1897] 1951) classic study linked differential suicide rates to institutional differences between Protestants and Catholics. Likewise, differential child mortality for boys and girls and unusual sex ratios among children provide evidence of differential treatment of children, even when indigenous people claim that it does not exist (Dyson and Moore 1983; Johansson and Nygren 1991). Racial and gender inequality in the United States are tracked by demographic measures of income inequality (Bianchi and Spain 1986; Farley and Allen 1987) and by measures of segregation in housing or occupations (Jacobs 1989; Massey and Denton 1993). The unobtrusiveness and behavioral basis of demographic indicators are important strengths: Although attitudinal surveys suggest respondents’ views may be changing, behavioral data provide an assessment less influenced by normative response bias.

The current study fits in this tradition. Focusing on data spanning the last 40 years, we ask whether the desire to have both a daughter and a son has disappeared, indicating the basic equivalence, or full substitutability, of sons and daughters. Such a finding would provide strong evidence of emerging gender indifference among parents and clear evidence of greater gender equality in U.S. society.

The current study also contributes to a demographic literature that links preferences for sons, daughters, or particular combinations of sons and daughters to fertility levels. More specifically, strong desires for particular sex compositions of children can substantially increase fertility. In the absence of sex preselection, Bongaarts and Potter (1983) show that if couples bear children until they have at least one son, then they will have an average of 1.94 births. If couples stop having children only after having a daughter, then they will average 2.06 births. If a child of each sex is required before parents stop childbearing, then they will have an average of three births. While the effects of the sex composition of previous children have been studied in many contexts (especially in Asia and in the context of high fertility), preferences for a son, a daughter, or one child of each sex have their greatest potential effects when parents want few children. High fertility implies that simple sex preferences (e.g., at least one son and one daughter) will be satisfied in the course of having a large number of children. In contrast, desiring few children and a particular sex composition can conflict. For example, if couples want two children and a composition of one son and one daughter, then half of those couples with two children will not achieve the desired sex composition. To the extent that composition preferences increase the number of children a woman has, we say that the sex of previous children has a pronatalist effect.","10.2307/3088947","American sociological review","Kinship; Demography; Psychology; Daughter; Context (language use); Normative; Child mortality; Economic inequality; Fertility; Indigenous","en",134,"https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2856967",305,"Used four decades of U.S. demographic data to assess whether parents' preferences for having children of both sexes have declined.","Parents increasingly show gender indifference, indicating rising gender equality in childbearing preferences.","Promote gender-neutral family planning policies to reinforce norms of gender equality in reproductive decisions.","Gender and poverty",NA

"389","Migration and Vertical Occupational Mobility","Richard Scudder; C. Arnold Anderson",1954,"STUDIES of social stratification in the United States have shown a striking contradiction in findings. The few studies of vertical mobility' report that a large minority or even majority of men are engaged in occupations with socio-economic status different from their fathers. The community-focused investigations of social classes, on the other hand, either neglect to report any observed vertical mobility or imply strongly that mobility is rare and class lines are firm.2 An exception is a recent community study by Deasy,3 who took the novel step of inquiring directly about new and former members of the elite group and about families who had failed in their attempts to enter the elite. It is significant that she found a considerable influx into the upper-upper class. Some of the sociologists engaged in the study of stratification have found it possible to reconcile these divergent findings. First of all, it is apparent that certain of the more active students of American stratification are not diligently looking into evidence on mobility. A second interpretation, which has been discussed at some length by Florence Kluckhohn,4 is based on observation of the failure in the community studies of stratification to record the origins and careers of individuals migrating into or away from the community. It is to be expected that individuals who leave their home communities become detached from stable status relationships and manifest unusual mobility. The present study attempts to test this hypothesis. The Kentucky community studied, containing about 1500 white households, is within an hour's drive of two moderate sized cities and within a hundred miles of two metropolitan centers. The ""fathers"" reported on are the white male household heads residing in the community and having one or more sons aged 15 or older who have completed their schooling. The sons are divided into two groups: those who have remained in the community, and those who have migrated. For each of these two groups occupations of fathers and sons are scaled and compared with each other. In addition, inter-generation occupational mobility is related to general social status scores of the fathers based on four combined indices: occupation, type of house, dwelling area, and prestige ratings by local judges.5 The combinations of occupations for each set of sons and fathers are shown in Table 1; the complete table is included because of the paucity of similar mobility data in the literature. The patterns of occupational inheritance and mobility here displayed resemble those found in the studies 1 Richard Centers, ""Occupational Mobility of Urban Occupational Strata,"" American Sociological Review, 13 (1948), pp. 197-203; H.

We find that despite the emergence of multiethnic neighborhoods, stratified mobility dynamics continue to dominate, with relatively few black or white households moving into neighborhoods that could be considered multiethnic. However, we also find that the tendency for white and black households to move between neighborhoods dominated by their own group varies significantly across metropolitan areas. Black and white households' mobility into more integrated neighborhoods is shaped substantially by demographic, economic, political, and spatial features of the broader metropolitan area. Metropolitan-area racial composition, the stock of new housing, residential separation of black and white households, poverty rates, and functional specialization emerge as particularly important predictors.

They also have neglected the fundamental economic reality of these mothers' lives-neither welfare nor low-wage work gives single mothers enough income to meet their families'expenses. In-depth interviews with 379 low-income single mothers in four U.S. cities show that welfare recipients and low-wage workers employ a set of survival strategies to make ends meet. The range of strategies available to mothers is shaped by the social-structural characteristics of the cities in which they live and by the quality of their private social safety nets. The authors argue that because some survival strategies are more compatible with work than others, the strategies a mother employs may affect her ability to move from welfare to work. Most welfare recipients want to leave welfare for work.

We address these shortcomings by investigating cross-sectional as well as longitudinal effects in the case of Germany, using a combination of individual- and regional-level data for several time points from 1994 to 2010. Our results suggest that native-born populations become more reluctant to support welfare programs when the proportion of foreigners at the regional level increases.

Kahn and Mason used a modified Age-Period-Cohort model of Mason Mason Winsborough and Poole. The modified model included not only dummy variables but also interactive terms for each of the youngest 3 age groups by their relative cohort size (RCS). This analysis was flawed because the focus is on the interactive effects of RCS while Easterlins theory describes RCSs main effects and because the statistical analysis had flaws in the interpretation of size of effect as well as a lack of significance tests. This commentary proceeds to evaluate Easterlins hypothesis by implementing an Age-Period-Relative Cohort Size (APRCS) model and then replicating Khan and Masons analysis by analyzing main effects.

Hence, the relationship between women's labor force participation and household income inequality is unclear in the literature. This study aims to clarify the mechanism through which the interaction between household income and marriage produces social inequality by using mathematical and simulation-based approaches. The presented findings suggest that the promotion of women's labor force participation has a temporary widening effect on household income inequality, but an attenuating effect in the long run. They also state that assortative marriage itself has no widening effect on household income inequality, but rather an accelerating effect on widening inequality.

Our index of welfare generosity has a negative effect on poverty net of individual characteristics and structural context. For each standard deviation increase in welfare generosity, the odds of poverty decline by a factor of 2.3. The odds of poverty in the United States (the least generous welfare state) are greater by a factor of 16.6 than a person with identical characteristics in Denmark (the most generous welfare state). Significant interaction effects suggest that welfare generosity reduces the extent to which low education and the number of children increase poverty. Also, welfare generosity reduces poverty among those with low education, single-mother households and young households. We show that Leftist parties and union density reduce the odds of poverty, however their effects channel through the welfare state.

Hughes",2020,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A robust literature has shown that surveillance disproportionately targets poor people of color through the criminal justice and welfare systems. However, little empirical research traces the mechanisms through which surveillance reproduces inequality in other domains, such as subsidized housing, where private actors including property owners and landlords do the work of surveilling tenants. In this article, I apply the theoretical lens of surveillance to the case of subsidized housing to explore the symbolic and material consequences of being monitored at home. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 67 low-income Black mothers in the Sunnyside neighborhood in Houston, Texas, I argue that the scrutiny mothers face in and around their homes reproduces inequality through two key mechanisms. First, surveillance creates a home environment devoid of privacy, that mothers liken to being in prison. Mothers interpret this scrutiny as an effort to control and contain them because of their race, reinforcing racialized notions of presumptive Black criminality. Second, surveillance heightens the material risk for mothers of being caught breaking rules, which paves the way for eventual eviction and exacerbates poverty. Although mothers develop strategies to counter and at times resist disciplinary monitoring, these efforts come with drawbacks that can make surviving poverty harder. Taken together, these findings suggest that being surveilled at home not only diminishes low-income Black mothers’ status in society, but also pushes them into deeper economic precarity. This research extends our understanding of the reach of surveillance into the lives of the poor even in spaces considered to be private.</jats:p>","10.1093/sf/soaa108","Social Forces","Sociology; Poverty; Subsidized housing; Development economics","en",23,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/100/1/293/6017446",380,"Interviewed 67 low-income Black mothers in subsidized housing to examine how surveillance shapes poverty and marginalization.","Housing surveillance fostered fear, control, and eviction risk, deepening economic and racial inequalities.","Revise climate vulnerability and housing policies to limit punitive surveillance practices and protect tenants’ dignity.","Climate vulnerability",NA

This study attempts to engage with this burgeoning field of research in order to clarify the empirical link between liberalization, economic growth, and income inequality. To achieve this objective, the current study compiles a panel data set of twenty-one developed economies during the years 1970 to 2009. According to the findings, liberalization returns a consistent positive connection with the pretransfer Gini coefficient using a range of regression parameters and robustness checks. Furthermore, although there is some support for the contention that liberalization indirectly decreases inequality by expanding economic growth, these results are far from conclusive as the findings are inconsistent across different equations.

Thus, we can agree with Davis who contends that ""to jump to ... the conclusion that prostitution can be abolished by eliminating its economic causes is erroneous. Economic causes seldom act alone, and hence their removal is seldom a panacea.""'9 Single factors rarely operate alone, be these economic, kinship, migration, and the like. Rather, we must view total situations of disorganization and stability in terms of interrelated forces which maximize and minimize each other, or even completely reverse potentialities inhering in single factors. The present inquiry into the sociocultural correlates of commercialized prostitution in Okinawa appears to confirm the hypothesis, arrived at on the basis of data in Western urban centers, that prostitution exists primarily in marginal areas in which there is marked population instability. At the same time, however, the data presented here also tend to point up the necessity of examining other forces operative among those who are immediately involved in the institution itself, namely, the quality of their kinship and community ties. In this way it may be possible to gain further insight into the forces which lead individuals in marginal areas into particular modes of behavior, both normative and sociologically dysfunctional. 19 Kingsley Davis, ""The Sociology of Prostitution,"" American Sociological Review II (December 1937), 749.","10.2307/2572801","Social Forces","Positive economics; Sociology; Kinship; Sociocultural evolution; Dysfunctional family; Quality (business); Institution; Population; Normative; Social stratification","en",7,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/37/2/168/2226714",391,"Analyzed the sociocultural correlates of prostitution in marginal urban areas to understand the role of instability and kinship ties.","Prostitution was prevalent in zones with population instability, shaped by weak kinship and disrupted community networks.","Strengthen community-building and migration support under poverty policy to reduce participation in survival-based informal economies.","Migration and poverty",NA

"404","Political Power versus Ecological Evolutionary Forces: What Are the Proximal Sources of Income Distribution?","Miles E. Simpson",1993,"This article examines Crenshaw's (1992) effort to reinterpret the relationship between political democracy and income inequality through ecological-evolutionary theory. His findings do not contradict the political theory of income inequality. Instead, when entered in a multiple regression, agricultural density controlling for percent of labor force in agriculture is a surrogate for land inequality. The distribution of political power remains the proximal cause of income inequality. In an effort to advance our understanding of the sources of income inequality, I tested a modified version of Lenski's (1966) theory. I hypothesized an inverted-U relationship between national income inequality and both political rights and resources education (Simpson 1990). Previously, income inequality has been shown to be either a by-product of modernization (Kuznets 1963,1976) generally on the activities of multinational corporations (Bornschier & ChaseDunn 1985) with all other findings either overshadowed by Kuznets' inverted-U hypothesis or suffering from serious methodological shortcomings. Instead, following Lenski's (1966) theory, I began with the hypothesis that income inequality flows from the relative political power of major groups in a given society and their relative capacity to dominate the distribution of a society's resources and opportunities (Simpson 1990). Hence, I argued that political forces determine income distribution not economic forces. In a society with virtually no political rights, leaders tend toward redistribution and although income inequality is hardly absent, it is relatively low. But in a society with a few rights, those rights tend to rest in the hands of a few often urban dwellers and merchants (Huntington & Nelson 1976). This enfranchised class employs their newly won power to extend their property rights which tends to increase their wealth relative to the masses.

Further enfranchising of other groups in the society lowers income inequality. I posited that education, a political resource, would have the same nonlinear effect. As predicted and different from many conflicting earlier studies (Sirowy & Inkeles 1991), I found a significant quadratic, inverted U, relationship between Bollen's (1980) Political Democracy Index (PDI) and income inequality. Furthermore, a similar relationship appeared between income inequality and educational enrollment ratio (EER). These relationships held even after several demonstrated correlates of income inequality were included in a full model. In contrast, log GNP/capita and its squared term were not significant when Bollen's PDI and EER and their quadratics were in the equation. I made some modest conclusions as to the implications of these findings for Lenski's (1966) theory of stratification. After replicating and extending my study, Crenshaw (1992) concluded that as his interpretation of the ecological-evolutionary theory predicted, economic development drives income inequality. To counter my conclusions, Crenshaw modified and extended the ecological-evolutionary theory by introducing two additional variables, energy consumption and a new variable agricultural density as measured by agricultural land divided by agricultural workers. In his view, political democracy and education are epiphenomena of economic development. He concludes that ""Simpson's dismissal of the 'logic of industrialism' hypothesis is unwarranted, and his assertion that class conflict is the principal engine driving income distribution would seem premature"" (357). The debate begins in earnest. Such exchanges, I submit, are healthy for the discipline. I hope that by clarifying our differences and similarities we will deepen our understanding of issues confronting comparative sociology. Here, I will compare the two studies, raise questions about Crenshaw's interpretation of his results and point to future tests of these competing theories. This will be done through examining the points where we agree and then where our findings diverge. Next, I will comment on the theoretical interpretations of two variables introduced by Crenshaw, energy consumption per capital and agricultural density. Methodological points will be discussed throughout. COMPARISON OF THE SIUDIES' THEORIES AND FINDINGS Although our interpretations differ, Crenshaw's study replicates four of my general findings: both Bollen's Political Democracy Index (PDI) and the educational enrollment ration (EER) have quadratic, inverted-U relationships with income inequality; the percent of the population below 15 has a positive linear relationship with income inequality in both study's full models; and finally, when the studies' proxy measure for economic development, logged GNP/capital (Simpson 1990) or logged energy consumption per capita (Crenshaw 1992), and their quadratic terms are entered with two other predictors, PDI and EER and their quadratic terms, both proxies for economic development fail to reach significance. In sum, both studies find the relationships predicted by the political theory of distribution. Only when Crenshaw employs his full model, does energy consumption per capita reach significance. Furthermore, Crenshaw introduces agricultural density This content downloaded from 157.55.39.219 on Tue, 19 Jul 2016 06:05:06 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Politics and Ecological Evolution / 799 the land area devoted to agriculture divided by the percent of the workforce in agriculture, ""a proxy for the social and physical carrying capacity of rural areas"" (339). Beginning with a nonsignificant zero-order relationship with Gini, r=-.12 and -.07, agricultural density reaches significance only in the full model. In both cases, energy consumption and agricultural density, the effects emerge after a suppressor variable or variables are entered in the equation. Crenshaw then concludes that (1) there is an 'effect of development on income inequality net of these other effects"" (355). This of course refers to energy consumption as the proxy for ""development""; (2) although EER and PDI have significant effects in the final model, according to modernization theory they are redundant in that industrial expansion requires more education and produces democracy; and (3) the older uneven development theory does better to explain income inequality than PDI or EER as indicators of class conflict. Now let us compare Crenshaw's conclusions with these results. Crenshaw contends that since agricultural density, a variable derived from ecological-evolutionary theory adds to the explained variance, ecologicalevolutionary theory better explains income inequality. The PDI and EER are then magically transformed from political to economic variables or proxies for great evolutionary forces which in turn are the true proximal cause of income distribution.

This remarkable change in the distribution of household income has spurred a great deal of research on the social and economic consequences of exposure to high inequality. However, the empirical record on the effects of income inequality is mixed. In this paper, we suggest that previous research has generally overlooked a simple but important pathway through which inequality might manifest in daily life: inequality shapes the ability of women to outsource domestic labor by hiring others to perform it. One important venue where such dynamics might then manifest is in time spent on housework, and in particular in the time divide in housework between women of high and low socio-economic status. We combine microdata from the 2003–2013 American Time Use Survey with area-level data on income inequality to show that the class divide in housework time between women with a college degree and from high-earning households and women of lower socioeconomic status is wider in more unequal places. We further assess whether this gap can be explained by domestic outsourcing by combining micro-data from the 2003–2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey with area-level data on income inequality and show that the gap in spending for household services between households of high and low socio-economic status also increases in contexts of higher inequality.","10.1093/sf/sox061","Social Forces","Income inequality metrics; Labour economics; Socioeconomic status; Economics; Consumer Expenditure Survey; Household income; Distribution (economics); Inequality; Economic inequality; Income distribution","en",38,"http://academic.oup.com/sf/article/96/2/481/4561577",398,"Linked American Time Use Survey and Consumer Expenditure data (2003–2013) to examine how income inequality affects domestic labor outsourcing.","Greater inequality widened the housework gap and outsourcing capacity between high- and low-income women.","Address class disparities in unpaid labor through income poverty policy that includes caregiving and domestic labor supports.","Income poverty",NA

Common explanations include changes in technology, demography, and labor market institutions. This study documents an additional driver of inequality that has been critical to the concentration of income among elites: income from investments. As they have turned to their investment portfolios for income, economic elites have become less reliant on the returns to labor. This finding indicates that the current debate over elite incomes, which tends to focus on the rise of “the working rich,” needs to be expanded to include the role of income-producing wealth. Additionally, such changes have left a dramatic imprint on the entire income distribution, with investment income contributing to a growing share of overall income inequality.

In an economic world woven together by global marketforces, local social structures can become key variables that influence which places prosper and which decline. We begin by hypothesizing that local capitalism and civic engagement variables are associated with positive socioeconomic outcomes (higher income levels and lower levels of income inequality, poverty, and unemployment). To test these notions, we employ data on more than 3,000 U.S. counties. Net of the substantial effects of the control variables, three measures of local civic society -small manufacturing establishments, familyfarms, and civically engaged religious denominations - vary as hypothesized in three offour models. The performance of these local capitalism and civic engagement variables suggests a robust association with beneficial local socioeconomic outcomes.

This indicates an advantage-leveling model in which individuals with prior advantages have the most to lose from neighborhood disadvantage during adolescence. I assess neighborhood socialization, school effects, and peer effects as potential explanations for the neighborhood effect. Supporting collective socialization theory, neighborhood economic opportunity and resource deprivation are key aspects of poverty-saturated neighborhoods that influence college graduation odds. Schools also play an important role in the relationship between neighborhoods and college outcomes.

"411","Public Transfers: Safety Net or Inducement into Poverty?","Jimy M. Sanders",1990,"A number of scholars contend that recent increases in economic dependency and poverty htave been stimulated by ""overly generous"" public assistance. Cash and noncash transfers and the eligibility guidelines that govern their distribution purportedly discourage employment antd encourage the rise of female-headed families. These ""culture-of-poverty"" arguments and alternative hypotheses are examined through time series analyses. The restults are mixed. On the one hand, the combined package of cash and noncash transfers is modestly related to the rise of female headship and economic dependency and more strongly related to declines in the labor force participation of young nonwhite males. On tle othter 1nhand, cash transfers reduce poverty. Though the current welare system is fraughlt with a nttumber of shortcomings, we find that culture-of-poverty explanations of post-1970 increases in econtomic dependency and poverty are not very powerful. A more comprehensive theory is called for. Such a theory needs to explain how structural changes in our econtomy are affecting economic opportunity. It has long been argued that poverty is better understood as a cultural rather than an economic problem (see Coser's [19651 discussion of Simmel [1908] or Harrington [1984:144]). Banfield (1968) and Gilder (1980) can fairly be characterized as the cornerstones of recent contributions to this line of reasoning. According to Gilder (1980:12), ""real poverty is less a state of income than a state of mind."" That is, the seed of poverty is a fatalistic mind-set wherein people give up on themselves as providers for their families. The availability of transfers that approach or exceed the value of earnings that many individuals are able to secure in the labor market reinforces such fatalism. The poor person becomes economically insignificant, so he or she does not have an important role in providing for themselves or their family. In this way poverty is sustained by the unilateral transfer of wealth from the state to the poor. This stigmatizes the poor in the eyes of the public. More importantly, the poor come to accept the stigma and view themselves as best suited to a life of welfare-dependency. They leam to view the labor market as a hostile environment in which they are more likely to fail than succeed. Welfare softens the hardship of not achieving economic self-sufficiency and thereby reinforces the motivation to minimize contact with the labor market. In addition, poor women with children can be denied certain benefits if they have an employed spouse. Thus, welfare discourages two-parent families and labor force participation among the poor. Consequently, economic dependency, or latent *1 would like to thank Elwood Carlson, Beth Ghiloni, Darla Ladkau, Bruce Mayhew, Miller McPherson, Patrick Nolan, Ken Shin, John Skvoretz, Shelley Smith, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Lala Steelman, Robert Stewart, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and the anonymous reviewers of this article for their criticisms and assistance.

Many scholars reject these arguments as ideologically inspired attempts to justify a ""hands off"" governmental policy toward the poor (e.g., Harrington 1984; Piven & Cloward 1982). Indeed, much of the research literature fails to support the contention that welfare has a largely pernicious impact on the poor. For instance, the review article by Danziger, Haveman, and Plotnick (1981) and recent collections by Danziger and Weinberg (1986) and Tomaskovic-Devey (1988a) point to a wide array of evidence that suggests that public transfers, despite their many shortcomings, improve the quality of life of the poor. But the culture-of-poverty perspective is not without empirical support. Murray (1984) compiles a great deal of descriptive data that lend themselves to a culture-of-poverty interpretation. Numerous analyses of the negative income tax experiment also suggest the relevance of the culture-of-poverty critique of the welfare state (e.g., Robins 1985).

We argue that using a racially bounded indicator of income inequality has greater theoretical parsimony than using a measure of racial inequality (white-to-black) or overall (total) inequality.

We explain this mixed support by introducing intervening processes at the global and national levels. At the global level, evolving characteristics of global production networks (GPNs) amplify the effect of Southern imports. At the national level, wage coordination and welfare state generosity counteract the mechanisms by which Southern imports increase inequality, and thereby mitigate their effects. We conduct a time-series cross-section regression analyses of income inequality among eighteen advanced capitalist countries to test these propositions. Our analysis addresses alternative explanations, as well as validity threats related to model specification, sample composition, and measurement. We find substantial variation in the effect of Southern imports across global and national contexts. Southern imports have no systematic effect on income inequality until the magnitude of GPN activity surpasses its world-historical average, or in states with above-average levels of wage coordination and welfare state generosity. With counterfactual analyses, we show that Southern imports would have led to much different inequality trajectories in the North if there were fewer GPNs, and if the prevailing degrees of wage coordination and welfare state generosity were higher. The countervailing effects of GPNs and institutional context call for theories of inequality at the intersection of the global and the national, and raise important questions about distributional politics in the years to come.","10.1093/sf/sox041","Social Forces","Counterfactual thinking; Welfare state; Labour economics; Economics; Globalization; Wage; Generosity; Context (language use); Inequality; Economic inequality","en",35,"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7bp4p1gt",414,"Used cross-national panel data to analyze how Southern imports, global production networks, and domestic institutions shape income inequality.","Southern imports increase inequality primarily where global production and weak welfare regimes intersect.","Revise income poverty policies to buffer inequality by reinforcing wage coordination and welfare institutions.","Income poverty","Inequality; Globalization; Comparative Political Economy; Economic Sociology Running Head: The Globalization of Production and Income Inequality Word Count: 10; 030"

Drawing on data from the World and European Values Surveys, National Accounts Official Country Data, Social Security Programs Throughout the World Reports, World Development Indicators, and World Income Inequality databases for 398,533 individuals in 95 nations (1981–2009), we use three-level hierarchical linear models to test four competing theory-based hypotheses—that unemployment shapes life satisfaction through individual, contextual, additive, or multiplicative effects. Our results support a multiplicative interaction between individual- and country-level unemployment. Unemployed individuals are less satisfied than other individuals, and when unemployment rates rise, their satisfaction drops even further below students, homemakers, and employed individuals; retirees, however, become more similar to the unemployed. We discuss these findings in light of previous theoretical models to argue for a model where individual unemployment is understood in the context of diverse labor force statuses and national unemployment rates.

"417","Labor Stratification and Violent Crime","Robert D. Crutchfield",1989,"T7his paper uses dual labor market theory to examine the relationships between the structure of labor in census tracts, economic indicators, and violent crime. It tests the thesis that relationships between poverty, income inequality, and violent crime are affected by the distribution of workers into the primary and secondary sectors of the labor market. The results indicate that, when three measures of the conditions of employment are controlled, the association between the poverty rate and the overall violent crime index is reduced, and that the relationship between income inequality and violent crime rates is limited to murder rates. The implications of these results for future research on social economy and violent crime are discussed. The history of speculation and research concerning poverty as a crimogenic factor (Bonger 1916; J. Cohen 1957; Merton 1949; Miller 1958) is long and notably inconsistent. For collectivities such as states, cities, and census tracts, research results consistently show a positive relationship between crime rates and levels of poverty, although the strength of this relationship varies (e.g., Boggs 1965; Chilton 1964; Jarvis & Messinger 1974; Loftin 1980; McCarthy, Galle & Zimmem 1975; Schuessler 1962). For individuals, the findings are much less consistent.

Following Pierson (1994, 1996), we find that states with an increasing tax revenue base and with a high proportion of Social Security recipients were quick to submit waivers, while states with a high proportion of Unemployment Insurance recipients were slow to do so. We also find evidencefor the geographic diffusion of waiver submission and that states experiencingfiscal crisis were more susceptible to the diffusing of waivers.

"419","The British Unemployment Assistance Program","R. Clyde White",1939,"HE provision of the means of subsistence for those without income or with insufficient income has been a public issue in Great Britain ever since the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. A national policy was first crystallized in the famous Elizabethan Poor Law of i6oi. This law remained the basis of general poor relief administration in both Great Britain and the United States for over four hundred years, although the law, the administrative structure and the procedure were changed many times. The most important principles embodied in the Poor Law of Elizabeth and later times were (i) the responsibility of the state for giving aid to the needy, (2) financing and administration of relief by the local government authorities, (3) eligibility for relief based upon a means test, (4) the pauper status of the recipient of relief, and (5) the necessity of legal settlement. The first major break from the Poor Law principles came with the enactment of social insurance legislation, of which the unemployment insurance law of I9II was an important part. Certain occupations were selected under this law for insurance coverage. The persons in these occupations henceforth, if they worked the minimum number of weeks in a two-year period, received insurance benefits as a matter of right for a maximum of 2.6 weeks in a calendar year and were freed from the necessity of seeking poor relief dulring long periods of unemployment. Insurance rested upon a whole new set of principles; the only one in any way common to the Poor Law was the fact of recognition by the state that it had a responsibility to see that persons without income through no fault of their own should be maintained. It was widely believed that insured persons would be removed entirely from the need of Poor Law Assistance. But after the World War this viewpoint had to be revised. During the war period new occupations were taken into the insurance scheme, and in i9Z0 the law was amended to include the large majority of all manual workers and many lowsalaried white-collar employees. The prolonged depression of business in Great Britain after i9Z0 created successive emergencies in the insurance system. Discharged soldiers were granted Out-ofWork Donations by the Government for a time, but in March, i9ai, this plan was discontinued, and a new uncovenanted, or extended, benefit was provided to persons out of the insurance funds. Persons were granted benefits from the Unemployment Fund beyond the period for which they had any statutory right, and many of them received the uncovenanted benefit without having acquired rights by virtue of contributions. In order to avoid throwing hundreds of thousands of people back on to poor relief the Government arranged to make loans from the Exchequer to the Unemployment Fund for the purpose of carrying the unemployed through the period of depression. This came to be known as the ""dole."" It was in fact a national relief scheme, except that claimants were not subject to a means test. * Read at the joint meeting of the American Sociological Society and the American Association for Labor Legislation, Dec. 29, 1938.","10.2307/2570697","Social Forces","Labour economics; Government; Statutory law; Economics; Insurance law; Means test; Legislation; Unemployment; Social insurance; Poor relief","en",0,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2570697",420,"Reviewed historical evolution of British unemployment assistance from the Elizabethan Poor Law through the post-WWI era.","Despite insurance reforms, large-scale unemployment crises reintroduced state-supported relief outside means testing.","Integrate flexible, crisis-responsive employment support into modern welfare policy to avoid regressions into punitive poor relief systems.","Employment",NA
"420","Housing Policy and Urban Inequality: Did the Transformation of Assisted Housing Reduce Poverty Concentration?","Ann Owens",2015,"Poverty concentration reflects long-standing inequalities between neighborhoods in the United States. As the poverty concentration paradigm gained traction among policymakers and social scientists, assisted housing policy was overhauled. New assisted housing programs introduced since 1970 have dramatically reduced the geographic concentration of assisted housing units, changing the residential location of many low-income residents. Was this intervention in the housing market enough to reduce poverty concentration? Using national longitudinal data, I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing from 1977 to 2008 only modestly reduced poverty concentration in the 100 largest metropolitan areas. The results are driven by the deconcentration of assisted housing after 2000, when policies had a greater focus on dispersal of assisted housing to low-poverty neighborhoods. My results suggest that even a substantial shift in housing policy cannot make great strides in deconcentrating poverty given the existing landscape of durable urban inequality. Assisted housing policy exists alongside many other structural forces that cluster poor residents in neighborhoods, and these factors may limit its ability to reduce poverty concentration. Moreover, new housing programs rely on the private market to determine the location of assisted units, and the enduring place hierarchy among neighborhoods may influence both where assisted housing is located and its effect on the residential choices of non-assisted residents in ways that undermine poverty deconcentration.","10.1093/sf/sov069","Social Forces","Labour economics; Metropolitan area; Economics; Poverty; Residential location; Private market; Longitudinal data; Inequality; Development economics; Intervention (law)","en",19,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/94/1/325/1754291",423,"Used national longitudinal data (1977–2008) to assess how deconcentration of assisted housing affected poverty concentration in 100 U.S. metropolitan areas.","Deconcentrating assisted housing modestly reduced poverty concentration, with stronger effects emerging after 2000 due to policies promoting relocation to low-poverty neighborhoods.","Revise urban poverty policy to combine housing dispersal with deeper structural reforms that counter entrenched spatial inequality.","Urban poverty",NA

We invert standard analyses of welfare state policy and household poverty by focusing not on poverty alleviation but poverty creation and exacerbation. Using harmonized household survey data, we show how the income and payroll taxes most rich countries rely on to finance the public sector serve to push households (further) into poverty. We estimate that across rich democracies on average about one in four households in poverty are made poorer on net after taxes and transfers; with fiscal impoverishment levels ranging from &amp;lt;10% in some countries to more than 70% in others, revealing extreme cross-national variation in how the pocketbooks of poor households are impacted by national tax and transfer policy. We go on to show that fiscal impoverishment does not track with standard measures of welfare state generosity but is instead largely determined by design of income tax systems, particularly a country’s relative reliance on (regressive) payroll taxes versus (progressive) income taxes.

"425","The Measurement of Intergroup Income Inequality: A Conceptual Review","Mark Fossett; Scott J. South",1983,"This paper reviews conceptual differences between popular measures of relative intergroup income inequality. To organize our review we introduce a set of guidelines identifying desirable characteristics of measures of relative intergroup income inequality and then evaluate different measures in terms of these guidelines. Significantly, we find that many popular measures (e.g., the ratio of median incomes, the Index of Dissimilarity, and the Index of Net Difference) have one or more logical weaknesses which prevent them from fully satisfying our guidelines. On the other hand, comparisons of group mean incomes (e.g., the ratio of mean incomes or the difference of the means for the logarithm of income) satisfy most of the guidelines we set forth. Additionally, we introduce a new measure of relative intergroup income inequality, the Index of Average Relative Advantage, which meets our guidelines and has an appealing interpretation. Social scientists have long been interested in two basic forms of income inequality; that between persons in a single population (intragroup income inequality), and that between people in different groups (intergroup income inequality). While the measurement of income inequality within a single population has received a good deal of scholarly attention (e.g., Allison; Atkinson; Blau; Schwartz and Winship), surprisingly little has been written about the conceptualization and measurement of income inequality between groups. (Exceptions include Lieberson; Palmore and Whittington; Villemez and Rowe.) As a result, measures of intergroup inequality are often selected on the basis of convention or convenience and the conceptual differences between different measures are not taken into account. To remedy this, this paper reviews the conceptual differences between a num*We thank Omer R. Galle, Aage B.

The organization of the paper is as follows. The first section introduces six guidelines for measures of relative intergroup income inequality. These guidelines clarify our thinking about the conceptualization of relative income inequality between groups, and provide a framework for comparing different measures of inequality. The middle section of the paper discusses a number of specific measures of relative intergroup income inequality, the extent of their conformity to the guidelines we have suggested, and the implications of failure to meet specific guidelines. This section also introduces the Index of Average Relative Advantage, a new measure of inequality. The final section comments briefly on our findings, the goals and problems involved in measuring relative intergroup income inequality, and the potential directions of future research on this topic. Guidelines for Measures of Relative Intergroup Income Inequality The Principle of Directionality Since the notion of inequality implies that group income differences may favor one or the other of two groups, it is crucial that a measure of inequality exhibit directionality. Thus, there should be some value representing the point of equality for the measure, with values above this point reflecting advantage to one group, and values below this point reflecting advantage to the other group.1 If a measure fails to satisfy this principle, it will be impossible to determine the direction of group advantage from the value of the measure alone. The Principle of Transitivity We next require that inequality scores be transitive. Thus, given three groups, A, B, and C, where the measure shows A to enjoy an advantage over B and B to enjoy an advantage over C, two things should follow. First, the measure should also show A to enjoy an advantage over C. Second, the measure should indicate that A's advantage over C is greater than A's advantage over B. If a measure fails to satisfy these requirements, it will not yield an unambiguous ordering of inequality comparisons. The Principle of Transfers Our third requirement is that, if income is transferred from an individual in one group to an individual in another group, the measure must change from its initial value to one that is more favorable to the receiving group after the transfer, and the change in the measure must increase as the size of the transfer increases.2 If a measure fails to satisfy this requirement, it This content downloaded from 207.46.13.48 on Wed, 12 Oct 2016 05:43:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Income Inequality / 857 will not always be sensitive to the clear-cut changes in inequality that occur when one group gains at another's expense. The Principle of Scale Invariance Our fourth requirement is that the measure should remain unchanged when incomes are multiplied by a positive, nonzero constant. Failure to satisfy this requirement opens the possibility that inequality will be a function of the arbitrary metric of income (e.g., dollars, cents, yen) or the impact of inflation. The Principle of Equal Additions To insure that a measure is sensitive to relative inequality, we require the measure to show greater equality between groups when a positive constant is added to all incomes. Conversely, the measure should show greater inequality when a negative constant is added to all incomes.3 This guideline insures that any given absolute difference in income becomes less important as the overall level of income rises, and more important as the level of income falls. The Principle of Symmetry Our final requirement is that the logical range of a measure's values be symmetrically distributed around zero with an upper limit of one and a lower limit of negative one. The result of this requirement is that, if two groups were to exchange income distributions, the absolute value of the measure would not change, but the sign of the measure would be reversed. If this guideline is satisfied, three desirable qualities result. First, the sign of the measure will indicate the direction of group advantage. Second, the value of the measure will indicate how far inequality is from its maximum. For example, a score of .5 would indicate that the advantage one group enjoys over another is one-half of the maximum possible advantage it could enjoy. Third, it is possible to compare scores above and below the point of equality to determine whether they are equally unequal. Taken together, these guidelines define an incomplete conceptualization of intergroup income inequality. This conceptualization is incomplete because adherence to these guidelines does not yield an unambiguous ordering of inequality comparisons. Different measures can satisfy each of the guidelines we have suggested, yet not rank group inequality comparisons in the same way. This possibility arises because we have not completely restricted the manner in which a measure of inequality must respond to different kinds of transfers of income. Our principle of transfers requires that the measure shift to show a greater advantage (lesser disadvantage) to the receiving group after a transfer, and that this shift be larger as the size of the transfer increases. It says nothing, however, of whether the impact of the transfer should (or should not) vary depending This content downloaded from 207.46.13.48 on Wed, 12 Oct 2016 05:43:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms 858 / Social Forces Volume 61:3, March 1983 on the initial income of donor and recipient. For example, it says nothing of whether the impact of a transfer of a fixed amount of income from one group to another should vary depending on whether the transfer is taken from a rich or poor donor, or whether the transfer is given to a rich or poor recipient. This ambiguity is unfortunate, but it reflects the fact that social scientists do not agree on this aspect of the conceptualization of relative inequality.4 We turn now to consider how various popular measures stand in relation to these guidelines, and the problems that result when they fail to satisfy one or more of the guidelines.

               <jats:p>Childbearing is at once deeply personal and shaped by social structure. It is also a site of profound inequality in the United States. Income inequality is an upstream cause of childbearing inequality, yet the evidence of the effect of income on reproduction is inconclusive. Previously, scholars primarily examined the introduction of means-tested relief to families with children. This limits analysis to families in poverty and provides insight only into the presence or absence of a policy. We analyze the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, which has provided all Alaskan residents with a substantial annual cash payment since 1982. The amount of the payment varies annually and is exogenous to individual Alaskans’ behavior and the state’s economy. We examine the effect of the cash transfers on fertility and abortion among a large and diverse population that has received varying amounts of money over time. We find the payments increase short-term fertility rates 1 and 2 years after disbursement, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Standardized to the 2010 household size distribution, two average payments relative to two minimum payments would result in a predicted fertility rate increase from 80.03 to 86.53 per 1,000 women age 15–44. The effect is largest for first births. The payments have no effect on the abortion rate.

"427","Structured ignorance and organized racism in the United States","Rory McVeigh",2004,"A theory of structured ignorance is developed and applied in an analysis of variation in the number of racist organizations in U.S. counties in 1997 and 2000. The theory identifies forms of structural differentiation that would make the worldview constructed within racist organizations seem plausible to a critical mass of individuals. I argue that racial and ethnic heterogeneity, industrial heterogeneity, income inequality, and changes in the economic structure within local communities provide ""evidence"" that may appear to be consistent with white supremacists' claims if individuals lack an alternative interpretation. Educational inequality, however, inhibits racist organizing by facilitating the exchange of information that could be used to reject the white supremacists' claims and by promoting passive acceptance of the existing order. Throughout much of the history of the U.S., a majority of white Americans have favored racial segregation based on a belief in the natural superiority of whites over blacks. Over the past fifty years, however, there has been a substantial decline in the number of Americans who openly express attitudes of traditional prejudice. Survey research shows that many white Americans continue to oppose policies such as affirmative action that are designed to promote racial equality (Jackman & Muha 1984; Quillian 1996; Schuman, Steeh & Bobo 1988), yet only a small proportion express attitudes reflecting a belief that whites are innately superior to nonwhites and therefore more deserving of basic rights *I am grateful to Peter Bearman, Judith Blau, Kathleen Blee, Dan Myers, Francois Nielsen, Tom Rotolo, David Sikkink, and Mim Thomas for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Compared with the control sample, skid-row men have long histories of low affiliation, both before and after their arrival on skid row. The two samples did not differ much in occupational mobility, but their affiliative patterns have been quite different. Apparently the disaffiliation of skid-row men cannot be attributed to their downward mobility. Whether downward mobility is accompanied by disaffiliation seems to depend on the context in which it occurs.

Brazil, which is undergoing a relatively rapid nutrition transition and has inadequate health systems, is currently experiencing the consequences of increasing rates of overweight and obesity concomitantly with the consequences of generations of malnourishment. Given this scenario, Brazil is an ideal context for examining the relationship between family socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent body mass, as well as how this relationship varies across very different regions within the same country and across the body mass index (BMI) continuum. Guided by a framework that integrates nutrition transition and fundamental cause theories, we use unique nationally representative data with measured height and weight for all household members to conduct quantile regression models. The results suggest that family socioeconomic conditions are important theoretical factors associated with adolescent BMI, but that the way in which family SES impinges on adolescent BMI varies across regions characterized by different locations in the nutrition transition and varying levels of economic development.

"431","The Welfare State and Relative Poverty in Rich Western Democracies, 1967–1997","David J. Brady",2005,"This study investigates the relationship between the welfare state and poverty with multiple measures of the welfare state and poverty in an unbalanced panel of 18 Western nations from 1967 to 1997. While addressing the limitations of past research, the analysis shows that social security transfers and public health spending significantly reduce poverty. Less robust evidence exists that social wages reduce poverty, while public employment and military spending do not significantly affect poverty. The welfare state's effects are far larger than economic and demographic sources of poverty.

However, many other scholars have discovered that either the influence of redistributive power persists or returns to human capital decline. In this paper, I analyze the effect of marketization on individuals= income inequality in urban China as mediated by work units, which are classified into three types: Low Profit State Firms (LPFs), High Profit State Firms (HPFs), and Market Firm (MFs). LPFs are farthest from the market, HPFs are closer to the market and MFs have to be completely exposed to market conditions. Results based on two urban survey data sets show that while the influence of redistributive power declines, returns to human capital do not monotonically increase, as market transition theory predicts. Although returns to human capital are higher in the market sector than in the state sector, the effects of education on earnings are weaker in HPFs than LPFs within the state sector. The inconsistency is attributed to the effects of bonuses that are equally distributed among employees in HPFs.","10.1353/sof.2002.0013","Social Forces","Redistribution of income and wealth; Labour economics; Economics; Profit (economics); Marketization; Market sector; Human capital; Earnings; Socialist economics; Economic inequality","en",96,"https://works.bepress.com/xiaogang_wu/1/",450,"Examined how different types of Chinese work units mediate income inequality during market transition using urban survey data.","Market sector returns to education were higher, but state-sector bonuses muted inequality, challenging market transition theory.","Revise income poverty policy to recognize persistent redistributive effects within hybrid state-market labor systems.","Income poverty",NA

We examine the effect of women's participation in SHGs in India on their social networks and social capital. We use household survey data, including rich social network information from seventy-five villages in rural Karnataka. In a context where women's interactions are largely restricted to their kinship networks and heavily constrained by rural life and patriarchal norms, participation in SHGs provides opportunities for socially isolated women to form new relationships. Descriptive analyses show that SHG participants, despite being more socioeconomically disadvantaged than non-participants, have significantly more incoming ties from nonkin than both non-participant women and men. After using propensity score matching to model selection into microcredit associations, we find consistent evidence that SHG participants have significantly more ties from nonkin and that these ties originate from other participants. We conclude that relationships formed within SHGs extend beyond the group and constitute important social capital, as women form friendships, give each other advice, and exchange vital basic needs resources.","10.1093/sf/sox021","Social Forces","Rural area; Interpersonal ties; Sociology; Propensity score matching; Basic needs; Context (language use); Intervention (counseling); Economic growth; Social capital; Social network","en",35,"http://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/95/4/1695/3074637",451,"Surveyed 75 rural Indian villages to assess how women’s participation in microcredit self-help groups affects their social networks.","SHG participants formed significantly more non-kin ties, expanding social capital even among socioeconomically disadvantaged women.","Fund microcredit programs that enhance women's social capital under income poverty policy in rural patriarchal contexts.","Income poverty",NA
"435","The State's Responsibility for Social Welfare","Albert G. Ritchie",1926,"SOCIAL welfare embraces a multitude of subjects. Prisoners' aid, juvenile delinquency and probation work are among its activities. So are certain aspects of psychiatry, and of the care of the insane and the feeble-minded. It is concerned with vocational education, rehabilitation and problems of education. It covers also health conditions, hygiene, social settlements and phases of immigration. The great subjects of poverty, dependency and charity are its special care. The sick, the afflicted and the aged come within its scope. It enters the home and undertakes to meet a variety of family questions there. The idea back of all these things-that those in need from one cause or another must be cared for by their more fortunate or better informed fellows,-is, of course, not new. Agencies to help the destitute date back hundreds of years, and in this country are as old as the colonies. The principal developments that are new are, first, a broadening of this field of usefulness, so that it has come to embrace a much greater variety of activities, and, secondly, special training and equipment for those engaged in social welfare work, culminating in the establishment of professional schools of social service in many of our colleges and universities. The State's responsiblity in this field is not easy to define. We start, of course, with certain recognized and accepted governmental duties. First, there are certain standards which the State prescribes through legislation. These relate to such matters as hours of labor, working conditions, health and sanitary needs, school requirements and the like. Next, the State accepts the obligation to provide custodial care and curative oz reformatory measures for certain classes,these including prisoners, juvenile delinquents, the insane and feeble-minded and generally the destitute. Lastly, certain lines of educational or curative work are recognized or coming to be recognized as State functions, such as clinics of various kinds, visiting nurses, industrial rehabilitation and the like. How far beyond these and analogous functions, and indeed how far within these functions themselves, the State should assume responsibility for social welfare, presents varying views, which range all the way up to those who believe that practically every aspect of social welfare is a governmental function.

"436","Conceptualizing Public Attitudes toward the Welfare State: A Comment on Hasenfeld and Rafferty","Michael O. Emerson; Mark E. Van Buren",1992,"Using structural equation techniques and the LISREL software package, we successfully replicate the results of Hasenfeld and Rafferty's causal model predicting public attitudes toward welfare state programs. By taking advantage of the ability of these techniques to incorporate estimates of measurement error, we also assess the consequences of imperfect measurement in several of their key variables. Our analyses yield results that fail to support the authors' original conclusions. In addition, we believe they bring to light several problems concerning the operationalization of crucial concepts in Hasenfeld and Rafferty's (1989) model. We conclude that a more rigorous test of the authors' model would account for measurement error while using measures that correspond to their theoretical de.finitions. In a recent Social Forces article, Hasenfeld and Rafferty (1989) present a causal model of public attitudes regarding welfare state programs. They contend that ""the social groups supporting the welfare state are the economically and socially vulnerable who identify with social democratic values"" (1027). Using data from the 1983 Detroit Area Study (Hasenfeld & Zald 1983) and a recursive path model, they find empirical support for their theoretical predictions. Yet, although Hasenfeld and Rafferty acknowledge that several of their variables contain measurement error and even report reliability coefficients for them, they do not examine the implications of this error for testing their model. In other words, they assume perfect measurement reliability. Our purposes, therefore, are to replicate their analysis using structural equation techniques and to estimate their model incorporating the measurement error. As we will demonstrate, the incorporation of measurement error not only changes the values of the coefficient estimates and their significance, but also reveals problems with the operationalization of three of Hasenfeld and Rafferty's key outcome variables. * We are grateful to Kenneth Bollen and several anonymous referees for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article.

"437","Public Beliefs About the Causes of Homelessness","Barrett A. Lee; Susan Hinze Jones; David W. Lewis",1990,"Using data from a survey of Nashville, Tennessee, residents, we show that public beliefs about the causes of homelessness emphasize structural forces and bad luck over individualistic factors. Our analysis also demonstrates: 1) the complex intrapersonal organization of these beliefs, 2) the degree to which they are influenced by one's social statuses, religious and political values, and exposure to homelessness, and 3) their implications for policy attitudes. Studies in the U.S. and abroad have found that members of the public explain social inequality in an individualistic manner: whether successful or not, people are deemed responsible for their own socioeconomic fate (for a review, see Kluegel & Smith 1981). This individualistic orientation is especially evident in Americans' beliefs about the causes of poverty. A decade apart, Feagin (1975) and Kluegel and Smith (1986) asked national survey samples to rate the importance of an extensive list of reasons for ""why there are poor people in this country."" The rankings of reasons yielded by the two surveys were nearly identical, with personal traits (such as a lack of thrift, effort, or talent) considered more important than structural factors (a shortage of jobs, inadequate schools, etc.). Though using noncomparable measures, other researchers have produced similar results (Centers 1949; Huber & Form 1973; Nilson 1981). One feature common to the inquiries into causal beliefs about poverty is the generic handling of the concept of poverty itself. Despite their many faces, ""the poor"" have been presented to survey respondents as an undifferentiated whole. Given the time constraints on the normal interview, that procedure makes sense *We thank Richard Appelbaumn, Karen Campbell, Joe Feagin, Jack Gibbs, Janes Klutegel, Mark LaGory, R.S.

When employed as a general stimulus, ""poverty"" may call up images ranging from welfare mothers to migrant laborers, depending upon a respondent's background, level of information, racial attitudes, and so on. In short, the generic approach precludes attention to the possibility that different types of poverty are interpreted differently by the public. In this article, we focus on causal beliefs about urban homelessness, arguably the most visible form of poverty during the 1980s. Our analysis uses data from a local survey to address five questions: 1. Is homelessness, like generic poverty, most often explained in individualistic fashion? Portrayals of the homeless in American popular culture have long stressed laziness, immorality, wanderlust, heavy drinking, and other character deficits as reasons for one's descent to the lowest rung of the stratification ladder (Bahr 1973). Similarly, from the perspective of the ""dominant ideology"" (Huber & Form 1973), the extreme failure symbolized by a lack of shelter must be judged the individual's own fault in a society where everyone is assumed to have an equal opportunity to succeed. Countering such ideological and cultural pressures to blame the homeless are recent treatments by advocates, scholars, government officials, and the media (Hombs & Snyder 1982; Newsweek 1984; U.S. Conference of Mayors 1987). The messages the public receives from these sources attribute the dramatic rise of the ""new homeless"" to a convergence of structural changes in housing availability, the economy, mental health policy, and welfare provision. 2. How are causal beliefs about hoinelessness organized at the intrapersonal level? Theory suggests that the holding of multiple beliefs about inequality may be common, given the range of social and psychological functions the beliefs serve (Kluegel & Smith 1986). Yet the generic poverty literature has often relied on closed-ended, forced-choice survey items and summary indexes that obscure belief patterns or configurations. Consequently, the reader is left with the impression at odds with what the most careful studies show (Kluegel & Smith 1986; Nilson 1981) that a person believes in either individual or structural causes of poverty, but not both. 3. Do one's social statuses influence beliefs about homelessness? According to previous research, being white, older, male, and of higher income increases the propensity to favor individualistic over structural beliefs about the roots of poverty (Feagin 1975; Gallup Report 1985; Huber & Form 1973; Kluegel & Smith 1986; Nilson 1981; Oropesa 1986). These findings conform to the principle that status advantages heighten people's stake in the system and support of the dominant ideology. The results obtained for education are less straightforward, perhaps because of the dual role it plays as socioeconomic measure and indicator of ""contact with liberal and humane values"" (Kluegel & Smith 1986:89). Region of residence has mixed effects as well. 4. Mhat other potential antecedents of causal beliefs warrant examination? People's religious and political values may shape their thoughts about the causes of homelessness. While recent advocacy by religious groups on behalf of the homeless has pushed some members toward a structural position, the lingering influence of the Protestant Ethic could actually strengthen the conviction that poverty of any kind reflects one's efforts in this life, thus encouraging an This content downloaded from 157.55.39.180 on Sat, 27 Aug 2016 04:45:10 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Beliefs About Homelessness / 255 individualistic orientation (Feagin 1975; Nilson 1981). The likely influence of political values on causal beliefs is easier to anticipate conservatives should be more inclined than liberals to hold the poor responsible for their lot but little empirical work bears specifically on this point. No research of which we are aware considers the everyday exposure of nonpoor urban residents to poverty and homelessness through informal conversations with friends, face-toface encounters on the street, and other sources. For each type of exposure, the central question remains the same: does the information obtained affect perceptions of why the homeless are homeless? 5. Are policy attitudes toward homelessness a function of what one believes about its causes? Both Feagin (1975) and Kluegel and Smith (1986) found proponents of the structural view more receptive than their individualistic counterparts to redistribution programs aimed at helping the poor. In parallel fashion, we would expect persons holding structural beliefs about homelessness to express more progressive policy attitudes concerning the importance of the issue and the desirability of various solutions. Interest in these attitudes goes beyond the merely academic: Burstein (1985), for example, has established a link between trends in issue-specific public opinion and the enactment of corresponding legislation. For the disenfranchised homeless, then, the causal beliefs to which others subscribe may have critical implications.","10.1093/sf/69.1.253","Social Forces","Public opinion; Sociology; Ideology; Social inequality; Human services; Poverty; Immorality; Dominant ideology; Blame; Social psychology","en",114,"https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/public-beliefs-about-the-causes-of-homelessness",442,"Surveyed public beliefs about the causes of homelessness and their impact on policy preferences using a localized study from the 1980s.","Structural explanations for homelessness were more likely to predict support for redistributive policies than individual blame.","Shape housing insecurity policy by addressing public perceptions and promoting structural understandings of homelessness.","Housing insecurity",NA
"438","Income Inequality, Intergenerational Mobility, and the Great Gatsby Curve: Is Education the Key?","John Jerrim; Lindsey Macmillan",2015,"It is widely believed that countries with greater levels of income inequality also have lower levels of intergenerational mobility. This relationship, known as the Great Gatsby Curve (GGC), has been prominently cited by high-ranking public policymakers, bestselling authors, and Nobel Prize–winning academics. Yet, relatively little cross-national work has empirically examined the mechanisms thought to underpin the GGC—particularly with regard to the role of educational attainment. This paper uses the cross-nationally comparable Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data set to shed new light on this issue. We find that income inequality is associated with several key components of the intergenerational transmission process—including access to higher education, the financial returns on education, and the residual effect of parental education upon labor-market earnings. Thus, consistent with theoretical models, we find that educational attainment is an important driver of the relationship between intergenerational mobility and income inequality. We hence conclude that unequal access to financial resources plays a central role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.","10.1093/sf/sov075","Social Forces","Economics; Key (cryptography); Access to Higher Education; Educational attainment; Earnings; Theoretical models; Parental education; Social mobility; Demographic economics; Development economics; Economic inequality","en; ru",158,"http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/06/09/sf.sov075.full.pdf+html",440,"Analyzed the causal relationship between social status, beliefs about homelessness, and support for relevant policies using survey data.","Higher social status and conservative values were associated with individualistic beliefs, which reduced support for redistributive homelessness policy.","Design public awareness campaigns under housing insecurity policy to shift beliefs and expand policy support.","Income poverty","I20; J62; J24 Income inequality; intergenerational mobility; Great Gatsby Curve; PIAAC"
"439","The Effect of Population Density on Welfare Participation","Thomas A. Hirschl; Mark R. Rank",1991,"This article addresses the paradox of rural and urban differences in poverty and welfare participation. That is, the poverty rate in rural America is higher than that found in urban America, yet the rural poor are less likely to use welfare. Results from an analysis of all U.S. counties indicate that population density is a major factor influencing participation in public assistance. Controlling for population compositional differences across counties, we find that residents in communities with lower population densities participate in welfare programs to a lesser extent. This study identifies possible explanations for this density effect. A paradox of the American welfare system is found in rural and urban differences in poverty and welfare participation. Although the poverty rate in rural America is higher than that found in urban America, the rural poor are less likely to use welfare (Bentley 1988; Duncan & Tickamyer 1988; U.S. Bureau of the Census 1990). Consequently, where the need for public assistance is largest, the use of such programs is smallest. This paradox is consistent with the perception that (1) rural community values are contrary to welfare program participation (O'Hare 1988), (2) access to welfare programs may be more constrained in rural areas (Bachrach 1981), and/or (3) urban welfare dependency is exacerbated by concentration and social isolation factors found in inner cities (Wilson 1987). Each of these perceptions implies that contextual factors across regions may mediate individual decisions whether ol not to use welfare. On the other hand, this paradox could result from quite different factors, namely, from population compositional differences that account for the discrepancies in rural/urban welfare participation rates. Perhaps urban areas have individuals with more favorable characteristics regarding welfare eligibility and use (e.g., greater numbers of female-headed families). Thus, a population * This research was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch Project NYC-159402, Thomas A. Hirschl and Mark R. Rank, Co-principal Investigators.

Surprisingly, research on welfare participation has ignored this intriguing paradox. The only study to date focusing on this issue has found a strong population density effect on the length of welfare use, independent of compositional differences (Rank & Hirschl 1988). However, the Rank and Hirschl study examined welfare patterns in only one state. This analysis extends that research by examining welfare participation rates for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC) and the Food Stamp program in 1980 for the entire 3,137 counties in the United States. It represents the first study to use all U.S. counties and county equivalents in analyzing welfare participation rates. If the earlier Rank and Hirschl findings are correct, then urban areas should exhibit higher rates of welfare participation than rural areas, net of the appropriate controls. The relevant control variables include various population compositional measures, as well as several measures that account for programmatic differences across counties. The hypothesis under consideration is that urbanity has an influence on participation rates, above and beyond the effect(s) of composition variables (Tittle 1989). Prior research has indicated that those participating in welfare programs are highly stigmatized by the general population (Coleman, Rainwater & McClelland 1978; Kluegel & Smith 1986; Waxman 1983). There are several reasons behind such stigmatization. First, use of welfare tends to jar the ethos of rugged individualism embraced by many Americans (Gans 1988). From this ethos, those who rely on government assistance for financial support rather than on their own efforts are perceived as failures. Consequently, individuals receiving welfare tend to be highly stigmatized by a public who hold strongly to individualistic beliefs. A second reason behind the overall stigmatization of those using welfare is the fear of encouraging dependency upon the state. As Goodban (1985) notes, ""afraid that handouts will encourage dependency, assistance programs stigmatize those who receive benefits to prevent them from asking for more, and to make it clear to others that there is an emotional price to pay"" (404). The hypothesis that urbanity influences the frequency of such stigmatized behavior is consistent with two major urban sociological theories. Both determinist theory (Wirth 1938) and subcultural theory (Fischer 1984) argue that deviancy and stigmatized behavior are more likely to occur in cities. According to determinist theory, urban size, density, and heterogeneity weaken primary social bonds, attenuate social control, and foster alienation of individuals. Cities are thus centers of social deviance and disorganization. On the other hand, Fischer argues that stigmatized behavior is more likely to flourish in urban areas as a result of subcultures that reinforce such behavior. As Fisher (1984) notes, ""according to subcultural theory, the signs of disorganization appear, not because social worlds break down and people break down with them, but quite the reverse because social worlds are formed and nurtured"" (39). Although these two urban sociological theories provide quite different rationales for predicting greater incidence of stigmatized behavior in areas with greater population density, the direction of the respective predictions are the same.

For example, since urban communities have greater size and density, they also possess more favorable economies of scale for public transportation. Transportation to a welfare office might constitute a greater obstacle to participation in rural communities. This should be especially true for very low income families who have fewer resources to pay for transportation services. However, the purpose of this article is not to adjudicate between explanations for an urbanity effect. Our purpose is to see whether such an urbanity effect exists, and if it does, to encourage subsequent investigations into the potential reasons behind it.","10.1093/sf/70.1.225","Social Forces","Welfare; Rural area; Economics; Poverty; Urbanity; Welfare dependency; Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Population; Demographic economics; Economic growth; Rural sociology","en",33,"http://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/70/1/225/2232756",470,"Analyzed welfare participation in all 3,137 U.S. counties in 1980 to test whether urbanity influences usage of AFDC and Food Stamp programs.","Urban counties exhibited higher welfare participation rates even after accounting for population composition and programmatic differences.","Revise social protection policies to address urban-specific barriers and stigma associated with welfare uptake.","Social protection",NA
"440","The Determinants of Public Attitudes Toward the Welfare State","Yeheskel Hasenfeld; Jane Rafferty",1989,"7This paper develops and tests a causal model of the determinants of public attitudes toward welfare state programs. It proposes that support of welfare state programs is a function of self-interest and the resultant identification with dominant social ideologies-zwrk ethic and social equality. Identification with these ideologies, in turn, affects endorsement of social rights and, hence, support of welfare state programs. Using data from the 1983 Detroit Area Study, the model is generally confirmed. The data also show, as expected, some important differences in the effects of the social ideologies on support of contributory vs. means-tested programs. The findings suggest that the social groups supporting the welfare state are the economically and socially vulnerable who identify with social democratic values. It has become a truism that the welfare state is in an era of crisis. In particular, the welfare state is said to suffer from a legitimacy crisis as evidenced by the recent decline in its growth rate and the fiscal crisis of the state (O'Connor 1973), the rise to power of conservative political elites with an anti-welfare ideology, and the declining credibility of the intellectual underpinning of the welfare state (Mishra 1984). Offe (1984, p. 157) asserts that both the Left and the Right agree that the present welfare state is no longer ""the promising and permanently valid answer to the problems of the socio-political order of advanced capitalist economics."" The intellectual attack on the welfare state is not necessarily reflected in mass attitudes, and studies of public opinion toward the welfare state portray a somewhat different picture.

"441","Racial Context, Black Immigration and the U.S. Black/White Health Disparity","Jen'nan Ghazal Read; Michael O. Emerson",2005,"The United States' black/white health gap is an important consequence of racial inequality. The gap is large, shows little signs of declining, and explanations have been limited by lack of theory and data. A new direction that offers potential for theoretical development is a focus on black immigrants, a group that shares the same racial status as U.S.-born blacks but experiences significantly better health. Using new data on the 2000-2002 National Health Interview Surveys, we disaggregate black immigrants by region of birth and develop a thesis that emphasizes the interplay of selectivity and racial context of origin for understanding health disparities among black Americans, namely that majority white contexts have deleterious health effects. The results indicate that grouping together foreign born blacks conceals important health differentials among this population. Compared to U.S.-born blacks, black immigrants from minority white (Africa, South America) and racially mixed (West Indies) regions have superior health, while those from majority white (Europe) regions fare no better.

"443","Polity, Economy and Technoecology: Alternative Explanations for Income Inequality","Edward M. Crenshaw",1993,"This article reviews Simpson's (1993) commentary and extends his analysis. His contention that the influence of agrarian population density on income inequality is spurious due to a mutual correlation with land concentration cannot be sustained when optimal data sets and alternative indicators are considered. Moreover, Simpson's use of educational variables as strictly political indicators is inappropriate; he in fact never substantiates his claim that politics is paramount in stratification. Finally, most of the explained variance in income inequality is a product of the shared variances of the independent variables. Simpson's references to unique contributions are specious. I agree with Simpson (1993) that this exchange of commentaries helps to clarify issues, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. While Simpson apparently advances several strong reasons to suspect my previous analysis (Crenshaw 1992), in fact his critique falls well short of the mark. His nine points of contention revolve around three central concerns. First, are agrarian population density and technoeconomic heritage related, and is density's influence on income distribution spurious due to its correlation with land-ownership concentration (points 1, 2 and 7)? Second, are political democracy and educational enrollments political or economic determinants of income inequality, and what are their relationships to national development (points 3 and 6)? Finally, Simpson questions both the validity of energy consumption per capita as a measure of development and its utility in explaining the size distribution of income across nations (points 4 and 5). To take up the first point, the use of agrarian population density as an indicator of technoeconomic heritage is easily defended on both empirical and theoretical grounds. Although Simpson's supplemental analysis demonstrates the powerful influence of land concentration on income distribution, which apparently negates the effect of agricultural density, we should not accept his *Iwould like to thank William Form, Lowell Hargens, CraigJenkins, andRobertKanfmanfor suggestions and comments.

First, he uses a nonoptimal source of data for land concentration; Muller and Seligson (1987) is preferable because these authors extend the Taylor and Hudson (1972)/Taylor and Jodice (1983) data on land distribution, yielding nine additional cases over and above the sample used by Simpson. Second, Simpson's analysis is a very narrow test; other indicators can be used to investigate the influence of agricultural inequality/density on income distribution. To provide a wider test, I also incorporate the percentage of agricultural households without land in 1970 (Muller & Seligson 1987) as an alternative measure of land inequality and the log of population density in 1960 as an alternate ecological-evolutionary indicator. Table 1 reports the results of replicating Simpson's supplemental analysis using larger data sets and alternative indicators. Gini coefficients of income inequality are dependent; both Muller (1988)/Simpson and Hoover (1989) data sets are compared. Equations 1 and 2 demonstrate that the log of agricultural density has a direct effect net of agricultural labor force and the landlessness variable, regardless of the formulation of the Gini coefficient. In equations 3 and 4, we see that agriculture density is washed out by the Gini coefficient of land concentration, but only for Hoover's sample. Finally, equations 5 and 6 suggest an unequivocal direct effect of population density on income distribution, net of other indicators and regardless of sample composition and size or formulation of the dependent variable. Although it is true that entering land concentration into the equation weakens the density coefficient, the ecological indicators are significant in 5 of 6 tests, direct refutation of Simpson's assertion that the density/inequality relationship is spurious. Moreover, these results are strengthened by eliminating influential cases, and other specifications, such as using land concentration weighted by the agrarian labor force (Muller & Seligson 1987; Boswell & Dixon 1990) lead to the same conclusions. To sum up, the results reported in my earlier article are robust; agrarian population density has a direct, negative effect on income inequality. If the question is whether land concentration is just one of many reasons that population density is related to income distribution, then the answer is yes. On the other hand, if the question is whether population density or agrarian population density are nothing more than proxies for land concentration, then the answer is clearly no. Why are population density and land-ownership concentration related at all? Simpson assumes that land concentration encourages low densities, presumably through capital-intensive agriculture which sloughs off labor and forces the population to subsist on inadequate lands or to engage in rural-tourban migration. To Simpson this allocation of land and tenure rights is clearly a political process, reflecting the unambiguous exercise of elite power. Although I would agree that the maintenance of high land-ownership concentration is in part political, this seemingly inordinate concentration of land may be in part a by-product of the transformation from horticultural to new agrarian society. Many scholars view land concentration as a result of colonialism (Boswell & Dixon 1990). What is often forgotten, however, is that the formerly horticultural societies of Latin America and Africa were thinly populated, a function of their technologies, and this shortage of labor fundamentally influenced the manner in which European colonists exploited these areas.

"444","Cross-National Determinants of Income Inequality: A Replication and Extension Using Ecological-Evolutionary Theory","Edward M. Crenshaw",1992,"Simpson (1990) suggests that curvilinear specifications for educational enrollments and political democracy are appropriate in modeling the cross-national determinants of income inequality, whereas the well-known curvilinear effect of national wealth, or the ""logic of industrialism"" hypothesis, is mediated by education and democracy. This analysis uses the same data on income inequality to replicate Simpson's research. Findings include the following: (1) most of Simpson's central findings can be replicated; (2) using a different measure of development, national wealth does exhibit a direct, curvilinear relationship with income inequality; (3) world-systems/dependency theory finds less support; and (4) agricultural density, used as a proxy for the social and physical carrying capacities of rural areas, has a robust, negative influence on income inequality, in accord with ecological-evolutionary theory. While attempts at synthesis have been made (Milner 1987), no comprehensive theory has emerged to explain income distributions within nations, although many theories have informed these investigations in the past. Specifically, modernization theory, dependency/world-systems theory, a variety of political theories, and ecological-evolutionary theory all suggest variables that may find purchase on this topic. The purpose of this research is to re-examine existing models of income inequality that attempt to test multiple theories simultaneously. In addition, this analysis introduces another hypothesis suggested by ecological-evolutionary theory and investigates its independent contribution to explanations of income distribution. * An earlier version of this article was presented at the American Sociological Association meetings, August 1992.

               <jats:p>Scarring effects of unemployment on subjective well-being (SWB), i.e., negative effects that remain even after workers reenter employment, are well documented in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical mechanisms by which unemployment leads to long-lasting negative consequences for SWB are still under debate. Thus, we theorize that unemployment can have an enduring impact mainly through (1) the experience of unemployment as an incisive life event and (2) unemployment as a driver of future unemployment. In the empirical part, we focus on one important dimension of SWB: overall life satisfaction. Based on advanced longitudinal modeling that controls for group-specific trends, we estimate scarring through unemployment using the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results consistently show a large negative effect of unemployment on life satisfaction as well as significant scarring effects that last at least 5 years after reemployment for both men and women as well as for short- and long-term unemployment spells. Further analyses reveal that repeated periods of unemployment drive these effects and cause even longer lasting scarring, implying that there are hardly any adaptations to unemployment that buffer its effect on life satisfaction. We conclude that scarring effects mainly work through repeated episodes of unemployment. Regarding policy implications, our findings suggest that preventing unemployment, regardless of its duration, is beneficial for individual well-being not only in the short term.</jats:p>","10.1093/sf/soac022","Social Forces","Unemployment; Life satisfaction; Economics; Demographic economics; German; Panel data; Psychology; Subjective well-being; Work (physics); Labour economics; Social psychology; Economic growth; Happiness; Econometrics; Mechanical engineering; Archaeology; Engineering; History","en",16,"https://osf.io/t57cd/download",485,"Used German Socio-Economic Panel data to examine long-term effects of unemployment on subjective well-being using longitudinal modeling.","Unemployment reduced life satisfaction, with scarring effects lasting at least five years after reemployment, especially for repeat unemployment.","Prioritize employment stabilization policies to prevent repeat unemployment and long-term well-being deterioration.","Employment",NA

Recent scholarship has begun to address welfare state effects on gender-related outcomes, but the evaluation of theories of welfare development with respect to gender factors is somewhat less developed, leaving open a number of important questions regarding gender as a mechanism behind welfare state development. Using established theoretical perspectives as a baseline model, this study evaluates the effects of women's political power on welfare state effort within 12 capitalist democracies. Cross-sectional time-series analyses of OECD data provide evidence for the impact of women's political representation on levels of social expenditure. Further, women's political representation mediates a portion of the effects of women in the labor force.

"449","European Constitutionalism and Industrial Relations","Hans-Jürgen Bieling",2001,"European industrial relations have undergone fundamental changes from the early 1980s onwards. This is mainly due to a range of structural shifts in the mode of economic, social and political reproduction. Most important among them are the following: the reorganisation of work and production (involving new technologies, rationalisation and labour shedding, flexible working conditions, changes in the production chain, or new logistic concepts); sluggish economic growth, high rates of unemployment and a highly fragmented workforce; an expanding service sector; and an accelerated transnationalisation of trade, production and finance. Two other significant factors are the increasing influence of banks, investment funds and insurance companies, and a transformation of the ‘Keynesian welfare state’ into a ‘Schumpeterian workfare regime’, which implies restricted opportunities for social and economic intervention. Most scholars agree that the re-launching of European integration since the mid-1980s should be seen as an integral part of all these tendencies of socio-economic restructuring (Ferner and Hyman, 1998; Martin and Ross, 1999). Without doubt, its core economic projects — the European Monetary System (EMS), the Internal Market, and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) — have had a serious impact on the transformation of industrial relations.","10.1057/9781403900814_5","Social Forces in the Making of the New Europe","Economic interventionism; Political science; European integration; Economic and monetary union; Unemployment; European Monetary System; European union; Trade union; Market economy; Industrial relations; Economic system","en",12,"https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781403900814_5",487,"Reviewed structural changes in European industrial relations since the 1980s including globalization, work reorganization, and welfare state transformation.","European integration and labor market liberalization fragmented employment conditions and weakened Keynesian protections.","Revise employment policy frameworks to protect workers amid economic integration and evolving industrial relations.","Employment",NA

The model is tested using the most recent cross-national data nowv available. We find no evidence of an independent effect of income inequality on sanctions or vice versa. However, we do find that politically exclusive governments tend to impose sanctions more frequently, relative to the level of political opposition, than more ""democratic"" governments.

Benefits disconnectedfrom marital status (parent and minimum benefits) are most effective at insuring against the new risks women face.

As family income inequality rose in the United States, parental resources available for improving children's health, education, and care diverged. The amount and rate of divergence also varied across US states. Researchers and policy analysts have expressed concern that relatively high inequality might be accompanied by relatively low mobility, tightening the connection between individuals' incomes during childhood and adulthood. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and various government sources, this paper exploits state and cohort variation to estimate the relationship between inequality and mobility. Results provide very little support for the hypothesis that inequality shapes mobility in the United States. The inequality children experienced during youth had no robust association with their economic mobility as adults. Formal analysis reveals that offsetting effects could underlie this result. In theory, mobility-enhancing forces may counterbalance mobility-reducing effects.

Buckingham",1948,"England, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was undergoing an agricultural revolution soon to be followed by the industrial revolution. During this period of transition, widespread unemployment and poverty existed as large segments of the population found no place in the changing economy. Gregory King estimated that ""more than one-half the population in the year 1688 was a charge upon the community.""' Although this high estimate may be questioned on the basis of other contemporary writings, yet the conditions in London and the towns were appalling. There ""children swarmed like locusts in the street ""some of them orphans, others bastards or foundlings abandoned by parents too poverty-ridden to take care of them. A parliamentary report of 1716 notices that those in the parishes legally charged with the care of these children were ""void of commiseration and religion."" The conditions in the homes of the poor were little more conducive to the bringing up of children. The filthy single rooms or cellars in which parents and childreni were ""heaped up"" afforded opportunity for neither cleanliness nor decency. Josiah Child noted that amidst all this poverty, neglect, and abuse not only was crime rampant, but the children were subject to so many loathsome diseases that the proportion of children who lived to grow up was small.2 To some contemporary Englishmen the existing conditions were ""the Will of God""; to others this poverty was regarded as the source of wealth in that it provided an abundant source of cheap labor. To others, more farsighted, the existence of this large class of idle nonproductive poor constituted an alarming drain uponi the national income. Two solutions were presented to the public towards the end of the seventeenth century: 1. The e'stablishmentof workhouses and working schools. John Locke advocated the establishment of working schools in every parish, which all children above three and under fourteen should be obliged to attend. In one such workhouse, opened in London in 1698, the children spun wool, knitted stockings, repaired clothes and shoes; and when they left at the age of twelve or fourteen, they were apprenticed to some craftsman or put out to service. 2. To others, the answer lay in religion rather than in the discipline of labor. This latter group of reformers felt that the Church of their day was utterly failingin its duty of providing instruction to the clhildren of the poor and, through neglect, failing to provide the poor with the means of salvation or moral improvement. This latter group was responsible for the extensive development of charity schools throughout England in wihich children of the poor were given catechetical instruction.

At the same time, role transitions (e.g., marriage, parenthood) remain important elements of the transition to adulthood in many low-income countries, and may be a source of resilience-allowing youth to shift their identity away from education towards a new role. In this study, we explore the mental health implications of young women's unmet educational expectations, and the possible buffering impact of motherhood, in a low-income community in Malawi, in southeast Africa. Analyses of six years of longitudinal data show that young women's unmet expectations to continue school are associated with multiple indicators of mental health disadvantage across two points in time. In the short term, however, this is only true of young women who did not enter motherhood in the midst of their educational plans going unrealized: young women who became mothers-and thus achieved a key element of the transition to adulthood in this setting-experience fewer mental health disadvantages. The findings demonstrate the potential mental health consequences of young adults' expectations exceeding their outcomes while also highlighting a source of resilience.","10.1093/sf/soz021","Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation","Mental health; Psychological resilience; Psychology; Element (criminal law); Young adult; Unintended consequences; Disadvantage; Identity (social science); Low income; Demographic economics","en",7,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/98/3/1112/5475559",519,"Analyzed six years of longitudinal data from Malawi to assess the mental health effects of unmet educational expectations among young women.","Unmet expectations were associated with mental health disadvantages, but motherhood buffered these effects in the short term.","Expand income poverty and education policy to support alternative adulthood pathways that protect mental well-being.","Income poverty",NA

In this paper, I use a relative bargaining power approach to explore the sources of pay disparity between executives and nonexecutive employees in the United States. I argue that the bargaining power of labor affects executive compensation, nonexecutive compensation, and the executive-worker pay gap and that this effect is moderated by the characteristics of the chief executive officers (CEOs) who implement organizational policies. An analysis of 185 US firms provides evidence that labor’s bargaining power reduces the pay gap between executives and nonexecutive employees. This effect is mainly through the unions’ impact on executive compensation. The results also suggest that labor’s effect of narrowing the gap becomes weaker when the CEO has a finance background or when the CEO was recruited from outside the company rather than being promoted from within. These findings shed new light on our understanding of the linkage between firm-level dynamics and the rise in income inequality.","10.1093/sf/sou004","Social Forces","Labour economics; Executive compensation; Economics; Compensation (psychology); Top Executives; Bargaining power; Economic inequality","en",65,"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/546219",521,"Used data from 185 U.S. firms to test how labor’s bargaining power affects the executive-worker pay gap.","Stronger labor bargaining reduced pay gaps mainly through downward pressure on executive compensation, moderated by CEO traits.","Strengthen income poverty policy by enhancing labor’s negotiating power to mitigate corporate pay disparities.","Income poverty",NA

We further argue that this increased lending had small but perceptible effects on residential segregation. But, the transformation of the home mortgage industry also gave rise to new lenders who were quite unlike the old. We contend that the nature of lending was even more important than the amount: some lenders and types of lending had much more of an impact on residential segregation than did others.

The education of the migrants, their earnings before and after relocation, and the change in the degree of antisocial behavior after leaving the reservation are analyzed. It is found that while relocation can enhance the standard of living of those participating in federal programs, budget limitations prevent these programs from assisting enough applicants, to markedly reduce the level of surplus labor on the reservations. T he purpose of this paper is to present information on the magnitude and character of migration of American Indians from the reservations to urban areas, and its effect on the reservation economy. There are approximately 380,000 American Indians residing on or adjacent to reservations (U.S. Public Health Service, 1966:10). These individuals comprise the most povertystricken minority group in the United States. The median family income for reservation Indians is $1,800 per annum, with 76 percent of all reservation families earning incomes below the poverty threshold (U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1967). Unemployment of reservation males in. 1967 was 37.3 percent of the labor force, or 50 percent higher than in the United States as a whole during the worst part of the Great Depression (U.S. Department of Labor, 1968:68).

               <jats:p>Previous research finds that unemployment leaves permanent “scars” on subjective well-being (SWB) that remain even after reemployment. However, this research systematically overweighs long-term unemployment, inaccurately measures employment transitions, often does not track individuals long enough to substantiate scarring, and does not always account for age-related changes in well-being. This paper uses event history calendars from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to track complete monthly employment histories of prime working age Americans over a 17-year period, and accounts for the temporal relationships between SWB, age, and employment transitions using a novel fixed-effects formulation. The results suggest that there is some variation in patterns of recovery by employment stability after job loss, but no significant differences were observed by the duration of unemployment spells. Within 2 years of reemployment, average SWB levels reverted toward baseline trajectories across all groups, showing no evidence of scarring. This study brings unemployment literature into better alignment with research on resilience and adaptation.

Garcia; Jennifer Glass",2021,"Socioeconomic inequalities in health and well-being are large, beginning early in childhood and accumulating over the life course, but they also vary widely across rich developed nations. Despite this well-known cross-national variation, research has yet to examine why children's health disparities might be larger or smaller based on national policy contexts and macroeconomic conditions. Parental health and well-being suffer under high work-family or economic strain, which may directly impact children's health inequalities by family social class. These childhood health disadvantages, if not substantially improved, compound to even larger adult inequalities. To examine the role of national work-family reconciliation in children's health, we merge country-level policy data with 2006 and 2010 World Health Organization child-level data on mental and physical well-being and family economic disadvantage. Based on adjusted estimates, we find greatly narrowed disparities in children's self-rated health as work flexibility and vacation-sick leave mandates become more generous. However, cash transfer policies including family benefits spending and childcare costs were not associated with the size of children's health disparities. Taken together, our results suggest the distinctive value of better work-family accommodations, rather than any generic cash allowances, for lessening family-based inequalities in children's health and human capital development.","10.1093/sf/soaa132","Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation","Comparative research; Social class; Life course approach; Political science; Health equity; Well-being; Human capital; Disadvantage; Demographic economics; Inequality","en",7,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34711998",536,"Merged WHO child-level data with OECD country-level policy data to test how work-family policy affects child health disparities.","Generous work-family accommodations reduced health disparities, while cash transfers showed no consistent impact.","Prioritize work-family reconciliation policy to reduce childhood health disparities under health equity frameworks.","Health disparities","Health disparities; cash transfer policy; children’s well-being; comparative research; work-family reconciliation policy"

               <jats:p>Ukraine is currently experiencing the largest human displacement crisis in the world. However, armed conflict that started in 2014 had already displaced nearly 1.8 million people in Ukraine, resulting in the largest internally displaced population in Europe. Although ethnically and culturally similar to the local population, Ukrainian Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) encounter severe economic, housing, and social challenges, as well as residual trauma from violence. In this study we examine the extent to which the subjective well-being (SWB) of IDPs differs from locals who were not displaced. We explore whether the difference in subjective well-being between IDPs and locals is due to economic hardship, inadequate housing, and/or weak social support. Using a unique survey conducted in 2018 and OLS regression methods, we find a sizable gap in SWB between IDPs and locals. The gap shrinks after accounting for economic and housing status, and support from local networks. Measures of loss in housing and social networks additionally account for the gap. However, none of the factors we measure can account for the difference between locals and IDPs who reported only leaving due to violence, pointing to the enduring impact of trauma on SWB.</jats:p>","10.1093/sf/soad124","Social Forces","Internally displaced person; Displaced person; Ukrainian; Population; Demographic economics; Displacement (psychology); Psychology; Political science; Geography; Development economics; Socioeconomics; Economic growth; Sociology; Demography; Refugee; Economics; Linguistics; Philosophy; Law; Psychotherapist","en",8,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/sf/soad124/51821706/soad124.pdf",555,"Surveyed internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-displaced residents in Ukraine in 2018 to assess the impact of displacement on subjective well-being.","IDPs reported significantly lower well-being than locals, partly due to housing loss, economic hardship, and weak social support, with trauma from violence remaining a key factor.","Integrate trauma-informed support and housing programs into migration and poverty policy to address the long-term well-being of displaced populations.","Migration and poverty",NA

Combining insights from Lilien’s (1982) “sectoral shift” thesis and the literature on deindustrialization, the authors assert that the decades-long contraction of the manufacturing sector has been a significant source of high unemployment in affluent countries. This assertion is tested against the literature’s existing explanations for unemployment using data from 16 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries over a recent 34-year period. Two-way, fixed-effects regression models suggest that deindustrialization has not only contributed to unemployment in these countries, but that it has been one of the more important causes of this phenomenon.

Using the multilevel approach that permits the decomposition of variance within and between nations, the results of the analyses confirm that rapid sociopolitical change at the macro level, such as the political transition from totalitarianism to democracy, produces a higher level of anomie among individuals in a society.

Unemployment is a particularly interesting issue in the partnership context because the ensuing loss of income may affect the entire family. Against this background, we examine how singles and couples differ in terms of unemployment duration and how a partner’s income and labor market–related resources influence re-employment. Considering the gender and class differences in labor market participation, we are particularly interested in variations in partner support between men and women in differing economic circumstances.
	 Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we find that cohabitation accelerates re-employment, whereas marriage increases the prospect of re-employment only for men. More specifically, the partner’s labor market resources facilitate re-employment. Although partner income has no effect in absolute terms, unemployed men and women who were formerly minor earners refrain from reentering paid work. This pattern is more pronounced among low- and medium-income couples than among high-income families.

(Average Monthly State AFDC Grant, Per Recipient/Monthly Per Capita Income of the State.) The two zvelfare measures are seen as linked to the societal-wide contest betzveen norms of achievement and norms of equality. American society is continually contradictory. At the broadest level it continually supports a contest between values of achievement, and those of equality (Lipset). At a more concrete level, American society has norms guiding the ways in which individuals might support themselves, and norms guiding them on what happens if they don't. One could characterize them as norms of work versus norms of charity. These norms become implicated in daily life-every time someone goes to work or sends a check to the United Fund, or applies for unemployment compensation or food stamps. These norms, however, not only generate controversy between each other, but serve as surrogates for conflicts over the values with which they are linked-work norms to achievement values, and charity norms to equality values. The contest between these two systems is not implacable; there are points at which they are mutually supportive. Yet neither is the contest equal. The values of achievement and the norms of work seem always stronger than the values of equality and the norms of charity.

"477","Unemployment Compensation: An Economic Tool","Israel L. Sonenshein",1947,"The whittling down of wartime controls climaxed by the end of effective price control has engendered a mood of holiday gaiety in certain circles as they envisage the ""killing"" which lies ahead. The most raucous laughter is reserved for those prophets who foresaw the likelihood of widespread and prolonged unemployment as a result of the sudden collapse of the war economy. Currently, after short spells of idleness immediately after V-J Day, there is numerically full employment, and at least in retrospect such a situation was fully to be expected in view of the colossal store of demand for all sorts of products built up in the war years. Whatever government officials may have said in a desperate effort to obtain continuation of vital controls and the enactment of full employment legislation, the following prognosis would have had a strong basi-and it may be speculated it's the one they actually had in mind: That the first 2, 3, or 4, or even possibly 5 years after the war would more or less take care of themselves; that the satisfaction of demands left unsatisfied at war's end would utilize labor resources with a great degree of completeness; but that danger lay ahead after the leveling off of demand to a point where it fell below supply, unless measures were taken in advance to prevent the collapse in employment which might follow. No reason is evident for abandoning that analysis, except to dilute it with pessimism. Though we are currently in a state of numerically ""full"" employment, jobs remain unfilled and perhaps two or three million are unemployed. Of these a portion are receiving unemployment compensation. Another group has already exhausted its rights but continues without work. It is not too surprising that this seeming paradox should provoke widespread ""exspos6s"" of ""abuses"" in the administration of unemployment compensation. The most systematic, though not the only effort in this direction is the series of articles which recently appeared in the Baltimore Sun relating to the administration of the Maryland law. A major point of emphasis in this seriesas in other critical comments-has been the opportunity given to unemployed workers to refuse unsuitable work without loss of compensation rights. The object of this paper is not to consider these charg s, but it may be appropriate to point out that their nature and the spirit in which they are evidently made permit the suspicion that more than an attack on abuses is involved. There is evidence that to a large extent the wages offered for unfilled jobs are lower than maximum benefit rates, to which, of course, only higher bracket wage-earners would be entitled. Such rates in turn are very much below current wages for skilled-and in many cases-unskilled work. Labor organizations look upon the current attack as an attempt to depress wage levels; but whether this is so or not, there is at least some basis for considering it as aimed at unemployment compensation itself as much as at abuses in its administration. The melancholy possibility of a bust after the current boom and the recent essays in exposure suggest the need for a new look at the basic function of unemployment compensation or insurance in our system of economic relations. If anything may be taken as axiomatic about unemployment compensation, it is the proposition that it must always be thought of as part of a total social policy. At bottom the proper end of a social policy is the expansion to the greatest possible degree of the living standards of those to whom it purports to minister. To put the matter a bit differently, the central aim of social life is to make increasingly available the means necessary for human fulfillment. The notion of higher living standards implies a decrease in the effort necessary for the satisfaction of bodily needs and a correspondingly wider opportunity to satisfy those of a non-bodily character. Unemployment compensation, along with other social security programs, must find its appropriate place in the scene set by this aim. As a result of economic conditions in the late 20's and early 30's, ""security"" has taken on an importance in our thinking it never before possessed. The fear of economic insecurity has been and may in the future continue to be deeply influential in the shaping of our social, economic, and political institutions.

We investigate a link between these by asking whether religion buffers against the negative effect of unemployment on happiness. Although theorized or implicitly assumed in many studies, empirical demonstrations of a causal, moderating effect of religion have been infrequent and often not strong methodologically. We conduct individual-level fixed effects models to test for the buffering effect in the US context using recent panel data from the 2006–2014 General Social Surveys. Religious service attendance, belief in life after death, and trying to carry one’s religious beliefs over into other dealings in life all substantially buffered the effect of unemployment on happiness. Praying daily, believing God exists, identifying as a religious person, and having a religious affiliation did not. We discuss these results in the context of prior work and existing theory. To further support a causal interpretation of these findings, we also conduct a secondary analysis showing that unemployment does not appear to increase or decrease religiousness.

"479","The Problem of Generations in an Organizational Structure","Joseph R. Gusfield",1957,"C ONFLICTS of power and policy between age-groups are a common feature of many organizational structures. Factories, churches, labor unions, and political parties often distribute power, prestige, and income along an age-grade hierarchy. The existence of ""old guard"" and ""young Turks"" is found in many areas of society other than the specifically political. This paper examines some sources of age-graded power and their consequences for organizational stability in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. A depiction of the age-grade problem as one of culture conflict points to the difficulties age differences entail for organizational unity.' Given such variables as rapid cultural change and competing cultural authorities, conflict between age-groups may be anticipated. Karl Mannheim has pointed out that the existence of generational differences leads to divergent political and social styles and modes of thought which greatly influence the character of public issues.2 When two or more generations appear within the same organization we may consequently anticipate factional conflict. In the Woman's Christian Temperance Union differences between generations have been most marked since repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.3 In pre-prohibition periods the WCTU functioned as part of a general reform movement with humanitarian aims. Its major interests and activities manifested a concern for the plight of lower-income groups. The central mission of the organization, total abstinence from use of all alcoholic beverages, was viewed as a solution to problems of poverty. In this period WCTU doctrine was the outlook of a socially secure Protestant middle class. Post-prohibition doctrine and activity of the WCTU has tended to express moral indignation toward contemporary American middle classes, rather than a concern for ""uplifting the down trodden."" Study of the socio-economic composition of WCTU local leadership revealed a decline in the socio-economic status of local leaders since repeal in 1933. The loss of prestige of WCTU membership has thus been a key problem within the WCTU.","10.2307/2573321","Social Forces","Political economy; Political science; Cultural conflict; Management; Power (social and political); Doctrine; Middle class; Reform movement; Repeal; Indignation; Politics","en",68,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/35/4/323/2226536/The-Problem-of-Generations-in-an-Organizational",744,"Tested the relationship between sectarianism, anomie, and socioeconomic status among urban and rural populations in the United States using survey and secondary data from the 1960s.","Sectarianism correlated more with lower socioeconomic status and limited abstract reasoning than with cultural shock or anomie.","Revise migration and poverty policies to consider structural class-based disadvantages rather than attributing marginalization to cultural disorganization.",NA,NA

However, such inequalities between generations are much stronger in conservative, continental European welfare states, compared to social democratic and liberal welfare states. As we show, this is because conservative welfare states expose some cohorts to high youth unemployment and make lifetime earnings dependent on a favorable entry into the labor market. We thus demonstrate that conservative welfare states have put the burden of adjustment to the post-1975 economic slowdown on birth cohorts that could not get stable jobs before 1975, while similar cohort inequalities are much weaker in liberal and social democratic welfare states. In these latter two welfare regimes, the burden of adjustment to the post-1975 economic slowdown was not put on the shoulders of some cohorts relative to others.

"481","The Resurgence of Race in Spain: Perceptions of Discrimination Among Immigrants","René D. Flores",2015,"The contemporary relevance of the concept of “race” has been increasingly questioned around the world. In Europe, researchers often look with skepticism at the US emphasis on race, instead highlighting the capacity of culture, especially religion, to explain native opposition to immigrants. Using two distinct data sets, I examine self-reports of discrimination among immigrants in Spain, where elites have long denied racial differences, to understand how the reported salience of boundaries based on race, nationality, and religion change with acculturation. I find that reports of both nationality- and race-based discrimination are relatively common for newcomers, while reports of religion-based discrimination are quite rare. Yet, unlike reports of racial discrimination, reports of nationality discrimination decrease over time as immigrants’ cultural differences decline due to their cultural assimilation. For second-generation immigrants, especially non-Europeans, race replaces nationality as the primary explanation for discrimination experiences and reports of religious discrimination grow even more infrequent. I conclude that, from the perspective of immigrants, the recent transformation of Spain into a new immigrant destination has gone hand in hand with the emergence of race as the main symbolic boundary marginalizing non-European immigrants in Spain.","10.1093/sf/sov056","Social Forces","Gender studies; Cultural diversity; Racism; Sociology; Skepticism; Nationality; Religious discrimination; Cultural assimilation; Immigration; Acculturation","en",54,"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/589049/figure/tab01",746,"Analyzed two datasets on immigrants in Spain to assess shifts in perceived discrimination based on race, nationality, and religion over time.","Racial discrimination persisted and even increased for second-generation immigrants, while nationality-based discrimination declined with assimilation.","Strengthen intersectional poverty policy by addressing racialized exclusion that endures across immigrant generations.","Intersectional poverty",NA

Exit Discrimination in the NBA","Davon Norris; Corey Moss-Pech",2021,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Diffuse status characteristics, such as race and gender, affect individuals’ professional opportunities and outcomes. Scholars suggest two possible explanations for these status disparities. First, uncertainty in measuring workers’ performances forces employers to rely on status as a heuristic or proxy for quality. Second, a history of racism and sexism in the United States creates a deeper cultural devaluation of low-status individuals that permeates organizational structures such that status advantage would persist even after accounting for observed worker performance. However, researchers struggle to accurately and objectively measure worker performance, making it difficult to adjudicate between these two perspectives. We overcome this problem using the case of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in which detailed player statistics are widely available to the public and decision makers. We analyze whether there is a racial disparity in the odds of exiting the league using discrete-time event history analysis. Using data from 1980–2017, we demonstrate that after accounting for player performance, Black players have 30% higher odds of exiting the league in a given season. We find this disparity is mostly driven by White bench players allowing us to elucidate how Whiteness operates as a credential in the NBA by giving marginal White players benefits such as longer careers than comparable Black players. These findings demonstrate that racial disparities in workplaces may persist even once performance is captured and in cases like the NBA where we might expect racial disparities to be minimized.</jats:p>","10.1093/sf/soab009","Social Forces","Statistics; Sociology; Jump; White (horse)","en",11,"http://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/sf/soab009/36337291/soab009.pdf",750,"Analyzed NBA player data from 1980–2017 to examine racial disparities in career exit probabilities using discrete-time event history models.","Black players faced 30% higher odds of exiting the league per season than comparable White players, revealing racial bias even after controlling for performance.","Target intersectional poverty in employment policy by addressing implicit bias in performance-based evaluation systems.","Intersectional poverty",NA
"483","Cumulative Causation, Coethnic Settlement Maturity and Mexican Immigration to U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1995-2000","James D. Bachmeier",2013,"This article applies the tenets of Massey’s (1999) cumulative causation theory of migration to explain variation in aggregate patterns of Mexican migration to U.S. metropolitan destinations during the late 1990s. Analogous to sending contexts, results suggest that the dynamics of migration vary substantially with the maturity of the Mexican settlement community within destinations (approximated here using characteristics of the resident Mexican-origin population and distance from the Mexican border). The rate of immigration between 1995 and 2000 was determined overwhelmingly by the rate a decade earlier, but the extent to which this was the case depended significantly on the level of destination settlement maturity. The immigration rate into newly emerging destinations was governed to a greater extent by pull factors in the local labor and housing market (e.g., unemployment and cost of living) than in more established destinations where the rate of immigration varied largely independently of such factors. Settlement maturity played a more direct role in explaining variation in the demographic composition of new immigration flows, and was inversely related to the percentage of adult inflows comprising unaccompanied males. The results are consistent with the hypothesis recently advanced by Light (2006), asserting that migratory shifts away from traditional destinations beginning in the late 1990s were driven, at least in part, by saturation of labor and housing markets resulting from network-driven migration. Implications of the findings for related avenues of research are discussed.","10.1093/sf/sot038","Social Forces","Circular cumulative causation; Metropolitan area; Economics; Destinations; Cost of living; Unemployment; Population; Maturity (finance); Demographic economics; Development economics; Immigration","en",16,"http://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/91/4/1293/2235831/",773,"Applied cumulative causation theory to Mexican immigration flows to U.S. metropolitan areas from 1995 to 2000.","Immigration patterns depended heavily on prior inflows and local settlement maturity, with emerging destinations influenced more by economic conditions.","Target migration and poverty policy to accommodate new immigrant destinations with tailored labor and housing interventions.","Migration and poverty",NA
"484","Poor Whites of the South","Mildred R. Mell",1938,"A NUMBER of recent events have tended to revivify the problem and dilemma of the ""poor whites"" in the South. The literary and dramatic scene, with its flood of literature about the South and its presentations of the South on Broadway, is, of course, one chief factor. It would seem that the Nation has become Tobacco Road conscious to the extent of a relatively new and almost universal caricature of the great body of poor southern rural and industrial folk as poor whites."" Along with this convergence of attention, from another direction has come the rediscovery of the farm tenants by both the North and the South emphasizing one aspect of the low standards of living and near-poverty of millions of southern folk brought into focus by the depression. The rise and incidence of regionalism, in which the trend is to inventory the several regions, due to the necessity of the New Deal differentials as well as to the general movement of American Regionalism, have been other factors focusing attention upon the human as well as the physical resources of the southern regions. It seems likely that this last may be the most important of all recent developments in that it furnishes the framnework for the present trend to study the people of the South as human resources in relation to the development of a richer regional and national culture. This study of the southern people is one of the ""musts"" in the program of research and planning for the next period of development in the South and the Nation. It is commonly said that no region of the Nation has been so completely documented as has the South. This seems quite likely, and certainly never before have there been such comprehensive inventories of its wealth and waste, its resources and prospects, and never before perhaps has there been such high motivation on the part of the South to achieve new realities in regional development and achievement. Howard W. Odumn, in Southern Regions of the United States, has made a most thorough-going analysis of the great resources of the South, both physical and human. He has shown that the region has a superabundance in potentiality of both and needs only the skill and technology of science and trained people to translate them, on the one hand, into capital and wealth, and, on the other, into richer institutions and a superior people. Theoretically, of course, this is the old problem of the conservation and utilization of the people in harmony with land and the folk regional society.","10.2307/2570919","Social Forces","Human resources; Standard of living; Harmony (color); New Deal; Dilemma; National culture; Regional development; Economic growth; Flood myth; History","en",20,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2570919",777,"Traced evolving public and academic attention to poor Whites in the American South during the Depression and New Deal era.","The South was extensively studied for its poverty and human capital potential, leading to renewed focus on regional development.","Revise education access and regional development policy to harness untapped human resources in historically marginalized areas.","Education access",NA

In particular, the literature debates whether exposure to ethnic others in local contexts generates conflict that mobilizes individuals to vote (mobilization theory), diminishes social cohesion that in turn makes voters likely to withdraw from voting (marginalization theory), or does not impact turnout at all. This study is one of the first to investigate the question using individual-level longitudinal data, which adds substantially to the causal leverage of the analysis. In particular, we use a panel dataset with validated turnout data for 1.9 million Danish voters combined with detailed data regarding the ethnic composition of individuals’ proximate residential neighborhood. The results suggest that increasing shares of immigrants does not affect natives’ propensity to vote to any substantive extent, irrespective of how the size of the neighborhood is specified.

"486","Dynamic Gender Differences in a Post-Socialist Labor Market: Russia, 1991–1997","Theodore P. Gerber; Olga V. Mayorova",2006,"We examine how the shift from state socialism affects gender inequality in the labor market using multivariate models of employment exit, employment entry, job mobility and new job quality for 3,580 Russian adults from 1991 through 1997. Gender differences changed in a complex fashion. Relative to men, women gained greater access to employment, but female disadvantage in the quality of new jobs widened. Although these two trends appear to be opposite, they are closely related. Both are connected to the introduction of market institutions, not gender differences in human capital or structural location in the labor market. How does the shift from state socialism affect gender inequality in the labor market? Many predicted that surging unemployment and the reallocation of jobs across economic branches and sectors would hurt women disproportionately. Others argued that market reforms would benefit women. Most studies addressing this question analyze gender wage gaps with cross-sectional data. We advance the debate by examining how gender differences in rates of labor market transitions (entry to or exit from employment, job mobility) and in the quality of new jobs change over time. We analyze employment histories spanning 1991-1997 from a representative sample of 3,580 Russians using hazard models for labor market transitions and logistic regressions for new job quality. Women are disadvantaged on the labor market to the extent that, relative to men, they have higher rates of layoff and voluntary employment exit, lower rates of employment entry and job mobility, higher odds that their new jobs are low-quality positions, and lower odds that they are high-quality. We model changes in the ""gross"" (zero-order) and ""net"" (controlling for covariates) effects of gender on these outcomes after market reforms. We compare gross and net effects to see if observable human capital and structural location in the labor market produce gender inequality. We find gross and net gender effects of similar magnitude throughout the period. These effects change over time, but in a manner that defies simple characterization as beneficial or detrimental to women. Relative to men, women gained greater access to jobs; however, female disadvantage in the quality of new jobs widened.","10.1353/sof.2006.0088","Social Forces","Human resources; Labour economics; Economics; Human capital; Wage; Unemployment; Layoff; Inequality; Secondary labor market; Socialist mode of production","en",54,"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/84/4/2047/2234920",795,"Examined gender differences in labor market transitions and job quality using Russian panel data from 1991–1997.","Post-socialist reforms increased women’s access to jobs but widened the gender gap in job quality.","Strengthen gender and poverty policy to ensure that labor market gains for women include access to quality employment.","Gender and poverty",NA

Dominant motive is work opportunities. Established relatives provide communication sources and other aids. T HIS STUDY analyzes the migration patterns of 386 Negroes from the town of Houston and its surrounding open countryside in western Chickasaw County, Mississippi. Materials were gathered during the summer of 1956 by interviewing 114 heads of household concerning the migration patterns of their siblings and children. The locale was selected because it had provided a considerable number of Negro migrants to the industrial city of Beloit, Wisconsin.' It was felt that a study in the home community of the Negro migrants to this small, independent northern city might reveal the extent of migrant dispersion from home base, reasons for migration, and patterns of mobility and stability among Negroes remaining in the southern rural community. All interviews were personally conducted by the author, utilizing a semi-closed interview schedule. Electric meter listings provided an up-to-date roster of residents, arranged by routes within districts. A 50 percent sample of town residents was first randomized and then selected at intervals of two. A 20 percent sample of open country residents was first randomized and then selected at intervals of five. This technique yielded 61 town and 53 open-country interviews. Assuming the head of household would be the name on the electric billing, this was allowed to determine sex of respondent. Thus 60 male and 54 female persons were interviewed. Analysis of localism and related values among the 114 heads of household has been reported previously.2 Suffice it to say, all of Chickasaw County had a decline in Negro population of 28 percent between 1900 and 1950, whereas the white population increased 29 percent during the same period. In 1950 the total population of Chickasaw County was 19,000 persons, of whom 44.5 percent were nonwhite.3 Chickasaw County is hilly, with some prairie in the southeastern section. Its agriculture is mixed, cotton, corn, and cattle. Basic industry is lumbering.

Martin",1976,"White and Negro inmigration rates into central city census tracts of five Virginia metropolitan areas were analyzed in terms of ecological characteristics-socioeconomic, demographic, and housing quality characteristics and the heterogeneity of these characteristics. As hypothesized, white inmigration rates exceeded Negro rates. Both white and Negro rates were higher in tracts with higher socioeconomic levels and better housing quality, and with smaller shares of Negro population but larger shares of families in child-rearing stages. Diversity of ecological characteristics proved to be less important than the tract characteristics, themselves, in the analysis of net relationships. Although the explained variance in Negro inmigration rates was much lower than that for whites, comparisons of the pattern of ecological determinants for the two races showed more similarities than differences. The loss of population, particularly white population, in the central cities of larger metropolitan areas has challenged policy-makers at all levels of government to retain current residents and to attract inmigrants to revitalize the central city. A second concern with the current patterns of population deconcentration stems from the resulting racial composition. Declining proportions of white residents yield racially segregated neighborhoods and public schools. Rejection of busing policies has turned attention to other means to integrate schools, such as strategies to integrate neighborhoods. While a wealth of migration literature specifies the nature of demographic, economic, and industrial characteristics of larger areal unitscities, metropolitan areas, states, and regions-which differentially attract migrants, little attention has been given to the ecological characteristics of small areas within the city which serve to attract inmigrants. I Yet, it is empirical generalizations at the level of the small area which are needed to provide guidelines for policy designed to upgrade the quality of specific neighborhood environments to attract white migrants and migrants of higher SES to central city rather than ring destinations. This study then is directed to discern the demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics of small areas within the central cities of Virginia metropolitan areas which differentially attracted inmigrants from 1965 to 1970. We compare the ecological determinants of white and Negro inmigration rates in order to derive racial differentials in the patterns of determinants important to each type of inmigration. *The authors are grateful to the Population Division of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who supported this research (grant no. 5RO1 HD0627 1).","10.1093/sf/55.1.72","Social Forces","Socioeconomic status; Human development (biology); Metropolitan area; Ecology; Geography; Diversity (politics); Population; Urbanization; Census; White (horse)","en",7,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/2577094",860,"Analyzed white and Black inmigration into small urban areas in five Virginia cities between 1965–1970 using census tract data.","Both groups moved more to areas with higher socioeconomic status and better housing, but white inmigration was higher overall.","Strengthen migration and poverty policy by improving housing quality and socioeconomic conditions in underserved urban tracts.","Migration and poverty",NA

Evidence for the population of the present study shows that official delinquency rates vary inversely with socioeconomic status.2 There are some who argue that differential enforcement of the law and handling of law violators from the socioeconomic levels of the population accounts for these observed differences in official rates of delinquency., But assuming the relationship between delinquent behavior and socioeconomic status to be valid, the question quite naturally arises, what is there about low socioeconomic status that generates high delinquency rates? One explanation for this relationship is Albert K. Cohen's theory of subcultural delinquency. A too brief statement of his theory is that working-class boys, to the degree that they value middle-class status, experience status frustration when in status competition. Status frustration generates a problem of adjustment and places these boys in the market for a solution. Delinquency is often a collective subcultural solution to this status frustration because it provides criteria of status which these adolescents can meet.4 Cohen's theory necessarily postulates that adolescents have developed a conscious awareness or perception of differences in class","10.1111/j.1533-8525.1963.tb01582.x","The Sociological Quarterly","Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Perception; Value (ethics); Enforcement; Competition (economics); Population; Frustration; Juvenile delinquency; Social psychology","en",29,"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1963.tb01582.x",896,"Investigated the link between socioeconomic status and youth delinquency using U.S. urban population data.","Lower status youth exhibited higher delinquency rates due to status frustration and limited access to mainstream success norms.","Target housing and youth poverty policy to address subcultural responses to status deprivation through early interventions.","Housing insecurity",NA

"501","A Reply to Stack","Marvin D. Krohn",1978,"The problems inherent in doing cross-national analyses given the current quantity and quality of data are well illustrated by Stack's comments on my analysis (Krohn, 1976) of the relationship between unemployment and inequality and the crime rates for 38 nations. While Stack endorses the findings on the other variables included in my analysis, he calls into question the reported relationships between unemployment and the crime rates because the unemployment data are based on ""unsound measurements"" which threaten the comparability of such data. I readily concur with Stack's statement that these results should be interpreted with caution and am grateful for his explication of the different measures of unemployment reported in the Yearbook of Labour Statistics (ILO, 1967). However, I cannot agree with his assertion that the findings on unemployment ""should be disregarded."" Since Stack does not provide any data which indicate the use of the unemployment estimates provided by the Yearbook have systematically biased the correlation coefficients, I would suggest a strategy of tentatively accepting the results until analyses using better measures find significantly divergent findings which would warrant disregarding those results based on the less comparable measures. In the absence of such analyses there are two ways in which Stack's assertion can be investigated. First, we can examine the correlations between unemployment and rates of crime only for those nations which have the most comparable form of unemployment statistics, the labor force sample survey data. This reduces the sample to only 11 highly industrialized nations, thus introducing a significant bias into the coefficients. In spite of this bias, the correlations found between unemployment and homicide, property and total crime rates (.40, -.43, and -.41, respectively) are consistent in direction with those reported in my original 24 nation analysis (.26, -.21, and -.003). Obviously there is a significant discrepancy in the magnitude of the correlations. However, this may be due to the fact that including only nations reporting labor force sample survey data limits the variability in the sample to industrialized nations. Research reporting time series analyses on the relationship between unemployment and homicide within 16 separate nations indicates that ""heavily industrialized, capitalist"" societies exhibit a strong positive correlation whereas other nations have low or inverse correlations (Archer et al., 1976). Thus, the attrition of countries when including only those nations with labor force sample survey data may have served to increase the magnitude of the correlations.","10.1111/j.1533-8525.1978.tb01176.x","The Sociological Quarterly","Economics; Spite; Comparability; Unemployment; Explication; Demographic economics; Sample (statistics); Inequality; Homicide; Survey sampling","en",0,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1533-8525.1978.tb01176.x",908,"Reassessed cross-national unemployment and crime data to address critiques of measurement validity.","Despite data limitations, unemployment remained positively correlated with crime in industrialized nations.","Revise employment-related crime prevention policy to account for macroeconomic conditions across countries.","Employment",NA

This qualitative study examines the cultural and moral forces underlying the tension between paid work and family responsibilities through the experience of poor and low-income women. Interview data reveal that as expected, the conditions of poverty and welfare shape work and family decisions. Yet, choices about work and family entail moral and emotional commitments defined through powerful gendered cultural schemas. Providing financially for children reflects a strong work ethic and moral worth corresponding to a masculine model of individual responsibility privileging self-sufficiency and independence. This is challenged by a shared moral imperative that mother's primary responsibility is the care of children.

According to the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity regressions, the agricultural–industrial transition returns stronger associations with income inequality in the United States before 1950.

Writers such as Rubinson argue for the salience of the world-systems model, while authors such as Weede claim that it is insignificant if we include a correctly specified control for level of development. This confusion is based, in part, on a debate over how periphery status should be measured. Previous work has often used measures of questionable validity, such as foreign trade, as a percent of GDP. The present investigation develops a conceptualization of dependency on the world market based on the concentration of export receiving nations. A multiple regression analysis of data from forty-three nations indicates that the index of periphery status does influence indicators of inequality. However, the parabolic model of level of development tends to explain more of the variance in inequality than the world-systems factor.

The formulation consists of two components: the principle that social phenomena exist in contexts with which they are compatible, and several distinguishing attributes of subnational collectivities and public policies. Taken together, these statements lead to the conclusion: if there is a match between attributes of a policy and those of a collectivity, then the probability increases that the policy will be adopted by the collectivity. General hypotheses derived from the formulation appear generally consistent with findings of previous research. Specific hypotheses derived from the formulation regarding city adoption of War on Poverty and National Flood Insurance programs are tested with cross–sectional data for a sample of U.S. cities.

Thomas",2003,"The unemployment problems of blacks in the United States have been the subject of considerable research in the social sciences since the 1980s. One way of studying the barriers to employment faced by blacks has been to interview employers, face to face, and directly ask them about their racial attitudes. These studies have concluded that a majority of employers believe that blacks, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, are uncooperative, unreliable, and lack sufficient skills for entry-level employment. The present study critically reexamines employer racial attitudes toward blacks and other groups through a case study of employer hiring in the electronics industry in Los Angeles. Using a different set of interview questions, employers reported (1) that blacks are reluctant to accept unskilled jobs due to a higher reservation wage, not because they lacked skills or a work ethic, (2) that employer racial attitudes varied by level of occupational skill, and (3) that affirmative action regulations modified the hiring process such that employers were less likely to rely on negative racial stereotypes in their hiring and more likely to rely on objective criteria when screening job seekers. I conclude by suggesting that employer racial attitudes are dynamic and, in large measure, shaped by institutional relationships within the workplace.","10.1111/j.1533-8525.2003.tb00556.x","The Sociological Quarterly","Ethnic group; Racism; Sociology; Work ethic; Industrial sociology; Affirmative action; Stereotype; Unemployment; Reservation wage; Demographic economics; Social psychology","en",22,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4120882",964,"Examined racial attitudes of employers in Los Angeles’ electronics industry regarding Black job seekers.","Employers’ stereotypes varied by job type and were shaped by institutional settings like affirmative action.","Revise employment policy to counter racial bias by reinforcing structural accountability in hiring practices.","Employment",NA

Although the welfare state is generally thought to support democracy by reducing economic inequality, it may paradoxically contribute to political disempowerment of some groups. We examine the effects of state interventions on civic participation among young adults, hypothesizing that involvement with stigmatizing social programs, such as welfare, reduces political engagement while receipt of non-stigmatizing government assistance does not dampen civic involvement. Using official voting records and survey data from the Youth Development Study (YDS), a longitudinal community sample of young adults, a series of regression models suggests that welfare recipients are less likely to vote than non-recipients, whereas recipients of non-means tested government assistance participate similarly to young adults who do not receive government help. These effects hold even when background factors, self-efficacy, and prior voting behavior are controlled. Welfare receipt is not associated, however, with suppressed participation in non-state arenas such as volunteer work.

This assumes a competitive labor market tied to specific controls of surplus populations. This article argues that contemporary labor markets lie on a continuum between competitive (secondary) and relatively non-competitive (primary) structures which creates a pattern of labor market segmentation. Such segmentation is linked with specific policies of incarceration or welfare, depending on the competitiveness of the labor market. Data from a cross-section of urban, industrial U.S. counties test the relationship between labor market segmentation, monopolization of industries, and the rates of welfare and imprisonment, controlling for a variety of other relevant variables. Regression analyses results suggest that as labor market structures become less competitive (i.e., move from predominantly secondary toward predominantly primary labor market characteristics), rates of welfare recipients and welfare benefits rise and rates of imprisonment fall. They also suggest that increasing industrial monopolization raises rates of imprisonment and lowers rates of welfare benefits. These findings indicate that the two major dimensions of economic segmentation (industrial competition and labor market competition) oppositely affect levels of welfare benefits and rates of imprisonment.","10.1111/j.1533-8525.1990.tb00338.x","The Sociological Quarterly","Welfare; Labour economics; Economics; Split labor market theory; Labor market segmentation; Unemployment; Imprisonment; Primary labor market; Secondary labor market; Labor relations","en",14,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4120972",987,"Examined how labor market structures, monopolization, and welfare regime variations interact to influence employment outcomes and policy perceptions.","Industrial monopolization reduced job opportunities and weakened social protections, disproportionately affecting low-income workers.","Revise employment and social protection policies to address concentrated market power and its adverse effects on job quality and worker security.","Employment; Social protection",NA

However, the literature seldom addresses the health effects for racial minorities produced in the workplace. This study bridges these two literatures in order to understand the mediating role of job insecurity in explanations of racial health disparities. Our central argument is that racial differences in job insecurity resulting from the marginalized labor market positions of racial minorities are partially responsible for racial disparities in health. This study utilizes adjacent category and partial adjacent category logit models of general health using data from the 2000 to 2010 General Social Survey in order to test this claim. Overall, the results from this study indicate that there are substantial racial differences in job insecurity, and both race and job insecurity are important predictors of general self-rated health. Additionally, racial differences in job insecurity help explain a portion of the racial disparities in health.

We use nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) to model whether parents seek information about their child's school before enrolling, whether parents move to a location so that a child can attend a certain school, or whether parents enroll their child in a school other than the assigned public school. Results indicate that enrollment patterns differ greatly across race/ethnicity. Whereas Black families are the most likely to seek information on a school's performance, White families are the most likely to use the elite option of choosing their residential location to access a particular school. These differences persist when controlling for socioeconomic status and sociogeographic location. Kindergarten enrollment patterns preserve the advantages of White families, perpetuating racial/ethnic disparities through multiple institutions and contributing to intergenerational processes of social stratification.

We use nonlinear multilevel models to analyze nearly 200,000 individuals across 248 cities, controlling for nonprofits per capita, religious congregations per capita, proportion of the population with college degrees, and the family poverty rate. While much of the intercity variation in volunteering is due to the composition of the population living in each city, we find general support for the predicted negative effect of social heterogeneity on volunteering.

Using both quantitative and qualitative data, we first ask whether the labor entailed by children’s organized leisure is divided evenly between mothers and fathers. Both data sets indicate that this is not the case, with the majority of the work falling to mothers; they also indicate that at least some employed mothers face a tradeoff between time devoted to paid work and time devoted to facilitating their children’s leisure. Subsequently, we consider key qualitative aspects of these leisure activities, including deadline sensitivity, authority over scheduling, and degree of predictability. These factors, we find, serve to exacerbate the inequity of the allocation of responsibility between mothers and fathers. We conclude by suggesting that organized leisure has become an important part of the familial landscape and thus warrants further attention. We also suggest that research on the gender division of labor would be enhanced in important ways by greater attention to qualitative dimensions of time use.

Drawing on interview data from both low-income first-generation (LIFG) college students and the parents of those students, this article examines how parents framed the achievements of their upwardly mobile, college-going children in relation to their own experiences of socioeconomic, educational, and occupational constraint. Engaging qualitative understandings of the “hidden injuries of class,” the analysis demonstrates how parents of LIFG college students reconciled their own experiences of limited mobility despite hard work with their steadfast beliefs in meritocratic ideals by (1) invoking narratives of personal “redemption” from past “mistakes” or “failures” in relation to their children's educational accomplishments, and (2) conceptualizing their upwardly mobile children as “aspirational proxies” through whose accomplishments they measured their own success.","10.1111/socf.12228","Sociological Forum","Social class; Higher education; Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Ideology; Narrative; Scholarship; Constraint (mathematics); Meritocracy; Social psychology","en",37,"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-58407-001",1011,"Explored how class-based trauma is addressed through faith and personal transformation among low-income individuals.","Religious and redemptive narratives provided emotional healing but did not alter structural poverty conditions.","Expand income poverty interventions beyond psychological support by integrating structural economic reform measures.","Income poverty",NA

This is both a missed opportunity for sociologists and a detriment to the study of adaptation. In this paper, we set out the following research agenda: bringing core concerns of sociology into the critically important conversation of how society will respond to climate change. We identify five broad themes in which sociologists can begin their work on adaptation: (1) structures and resource access, (2) social cohesion and future planning, (3) constraints of social stratifications, (4) power and agency in decision‐making, and (5) justice in process and outcomes. After summarizing existing sociological work on adaptation and detailing our research agenda, we draw examples from our own work in Bangladesh to illustrate how this agenda might be taken up. In doing so, we point to several places where sociological insights come into play in questions related to development, organizations, expertise, migration, gender, and labor.

I analyze the socialities of sharing knowledge and resources among disadvantaged students, which I call “infrastructures of sociality.” “Infrastructure” designates here two things: first, the role of the university's infrastructure—its physical spaces and organizational routines—in enabling social ties; and second, the fact that these social ties literally function as infrastructure, in that they make university life possible for disadvantaged students, especially in the context of institutional neglect. I therefore advance Bourdieusian scholarship that views social ties among disadvantaged students as merely lacking in social capital, arguing instead that these ties constitute a form of non‐dominant social capital that is analytically distinct and powerful in its own right. Yet, I suggest that these social ties are a double‐edged sword: while the intensive mutual aid of disadvantaged students makes university participation possible, it nonetheless rests on exclusion from more privileged social groups. Thus, despite mitigating exclusion from the university, infrastructures of sociality also inadvertently participate in the reproduction of inequality, by reinforcing exclusion from the elite cultural and social resources circulating among privileged students.</jats:p>","10.1111/socf.12874","Sociological Forum","Disadvantaged; Sociality; Sociology; Interpersonal ties; Social capital; Scholarship; Context (archaeology); Social exclusion; Gender studies; Social science; Economic growth; Economics; Ecology; Paleontology; Biology","en",5,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/socf.12874",1018,"Examined how disadvantaged students create informal infrastructures of social support within schools.","Peer and staff networks substituted for institutional resources, helping mitigate inequality in educational outcomes.","Strengthen institutional support systems to reduce reliance on informal networks and improve education access.","Education access",NA

I advance prior theorizing in this area by considering whether clients’ “bodily capital” impacts the services they receive. I find that despite providing needed services to clients, the organization reifies many of the inequalities it seeks to remedy. When sorting clothing donations, staff and volunteers curate particularly classed embodiments by selecting garments that are work‐appropriate yet not luxurious. Also, well‐intentioned efforts to provide a luxurious shopping‐esque experience for clients ironically produces service scripts that facilitate control over clients’ behavior. Finally, service interactions reproduce inequities between different types of clients along the lines of race, class, and body size, such that clients with more privileged bodily capital fare better than those with stigmatized embodiments. I use these findings to caution against romanticized understandings of philanthropic efforts to remedy social inequality, while also underscoring the importance of taking embodiment—particularly the striking social disadvantages of larger body size—into account when examining the intersections of gender, race, and class.</jats:p>","10.1111/socf.12480","Sociological Forum","Welfare; Gender studies; Sociology; Work (electrical); Class (computer programming); Intersectionality; Nonprofit organization; Body size; Race (biology)","en",8,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/socf.12480",1021,"Analyzed makeovers as a policy tool used to shape public assistance recipients' self-presentation and work readiness.","Policy-driven makeovers reinforced gendered and racialized ideals while failing to address root causes of poverty.","Revise social protection policies to focus on structural poverty alleviation rather than image-based interventions.","Social protection",NA

Hurricane Katrina survivors were caught between two opposing cultural characterizations—”deserving” disaster victims and “undeserving” welfare cheats. In this article, I examine Hurricane Katrina survivors' experiences with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s rental assistance policies and practices, as their experiences reveal important aspects of how aid is allocated in the context of the contemporary U.S. welfare state, and what consequences this has for marginalized populations. I analyze in-depth interviews and field observations with displaced Katrina survivors and find that FEMA policies and practices assumed a “middle class” model of family structure and economic standing. Those who did not fit into this model were made to wait while their cases were investigated, which had negative psychological and material consequences. I argue that being made to wait, or temporal domination, is a central component of the larger sociotemporal marginalization of the poor, or the way in which time structures social stratification. Temporal domination is a feature of neoliberal social policy, neither maliciously intended nor entirely unintended, that has the consequence of punishing the “undeserving.”","10.1111/socf.12051","Sociological Forum","Welfare; Welfare state; Agency (sociology); Sociology; Social policy; Middle class; Context (language use); Public administration; Social stratification; Emergency management; Criminology","en",61,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/socf.12051",1022,"Investigated how perceptions of deservingness affect public and policy responses to poverty over time.","Moral judgments about time use and productivity shaped access to assistance, disadvantaging certain groups.","Target social protection reforms to counteract temporal bias and expand inclusive eligibility criteria.","Social protection",NA

For some, globalization increases income inequality, while for others, globalization has no, or a negligible, effect on income inequality. This study brings new evidence to bear on this debate by separately investigating effects of multiple indicators of globalization (international trade, foreign direct investment [FDI] and immigration), and of welfare state generosity (government social‐protection spending) on (1) income inequality before taxes and transfers and (2) income inequality after taxes and transfers, using data from 23 Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) countries over 1990–2009. First, results show a positive effect of international trade, a negative effect of immigration, but no effect of FDI and government social‐protection spending on income inequality before taxes and transfers. Second, results show no effect of the globalization indicators but a negative effect of government social‐protection spending on income inequality after taxes and transfers.

Using data from the National Household Education Survey (2007), I evaluate the impact of general demographic, student-level, and school variables on the likelihood of prep. A key finding of these analyses is that pooling high school students can obscure differences in participation in test prep by grade. The likelihood of prepping increases for each grade, with 42% of 12th graders but only 8% of 9th graders participating. Black non-Hispanic students are more likely to participate in test prep, and there are also significant interaction effects of race and grade level on prep, with black 11th graders having the highest predicted probability of prep. Student and parent involvement are statistically significant across most models, but with relatively small substantive association.

This article extends this literature by presenting data highlighting the cultural and social contingencies that account for differences in experiences of class marginality. The degree of cultural and social dissimilarity between one’s life before and during college helps explain variation in experiences. I contrast the experiences of two groups of lower-income, black undergraduates—the Doubly Disadvantaged and Privileged Poor. Although from comparable disadvantaged households and neighborhoods, they travel along divergent paths to college. Unlike the Doubly Disadvantaged, whose precollege experiences are localized, the Privileged Poor cross social boundaries for school. In college, the Doubly Disadvantaged report negative interactions with peers and professors and adopt isolationist strategies, while the Privileged Poor generally report positive interactions and adopt integrationist strategies.

How does continuity of work, family, and welfare affect low-income women’s health insurance status? A multinomial logistic regression analysis of 1,662 low-income women from the Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study provides evidence of the consequences of life changes on access to health insurance from 1999–2005. The results show that compared to those with stable welfare, work, and family attachments, new full-time employment actually increases low-income women’s risk of being uninsured as does being underemployed, on welfare, or single for extended periods of time.

Results of two-way fixed-effects longitudinal models indicate that the relationship between national-level emissions and inequality changes through time and varies for nations in different macroeconomic contexts. For high-income nations, the relationship shifts from negative to positive, suggesting that in recent years, income inequality in such nations increases carbon emissions. For middle-income nations, the association is negative, and becomes increasingly negative in the later years of the study. For low-income nations, the relationship between carbon emissions and domestic income inequality is null for the entire 1991 to 2008 period.

Results of our analysis reveal that linguistic heterogeneity is associated with increased violence and that this relationship is stronger in disadvantaged contexts. In contrast, Spanish-language concentration appears to be protective against violence and mitigates the violence-generating effects of structural disadvantage, net of immigration and other macrostructural characteristics.

Murphy",2010,"Poverty has increased significantly in U.S. suburbs since the 1990s. What we know about suburban poverty is largely limited to demographic and economic information. Building off the organizational perspective approach, I use in-depth interviews with nonprofit, antipoverty organizations in eight Pennsylvania suburbs to better understand the suburban poverty experience. My focus is on how organizations compete for external resources. By working directly with the poverty problem while also working in broader metropolitan political and economic fields of decision making, this ""middle-man"" role (Marwell, 2007) gives us insights into contemporary poverty dynamics for suburbs. I find that how suburban organizational leaders perceive the challenges they face, and what strategies they adopt to confront such difficulties, revolves around symbolic dilemmas posed by the history, distribution, and politics of poverty in the suburbs. Symbolic dilemmas cluster around three different situational contexts of poverty in the suburbs. I use this to develop a three-part typology of suburban poverty: symbiotic suburbs, skeletal suburbs, and overshadowed suburbs. This typology has implications for future research and for policymakers interested in developing tools to appropriately address this pressing issue.","10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01195.x","Sociological Forum","Sociology; Metropolitan area; Culture of poverty; Social dilemma; Poverty; Social policy; Economic growth; Typology; Situational ethics; Politics","en",33,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40783515",1034,"Examined symbolic boundaries and stigma faced by suburban poor populations in relation to urban and rural poverty.","Suburban poor experienced heightened invisibility and lacked access to services typically available in urban cores.","Revise urban and rural poverty strategies to explicitly include and support suburban low-income communities.","Rural poverty; Urban poverty",NA
"546","Symposium on William Julius Wilson’s More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City","Margaret L. Andersen",2010,"For more than 30 years, William Julius Wilson has engaged social scientists and public policymakers in an analysis of urban poverty and persistent racial inequality. Wilson's fundamental question over the long course of his career is why poverty persists for so many African Americans (2009:3). He has forcefully argued that social structural transformations and historical changes in the political economy are the primary basis for racial inequality and its interaction with class (Wilson 1973, 1978, 1987, 1996, 1999). In Wilson's argument, it is the persistent power of social structure (including the disappearance of work, the decimation of inner cities, and the abandonment of progressive social policies) not attitudes or values that results in urban poverty and its concomitant social problems. His comprehensive and lucid analyses of urban inequality, based on both his rich Chicago study and detailed secondary analysis, have informed the academy and, importantly, also major public figures, including presidents, mayors, governors, and the educated lay public. Indeed, there is probably no other sociologist who has so consistently had the attention of key policymakers, even at times when public policy has turned away from the progressive programs and policies that Wilson would endorse. Thus, when William Julius Wilson says now that we should be paying attention to culture, people listen. Implicit in Wilson's earlier work, although never as directly addressed before, is an argument with cultural determinists who ignore the structural causes of disadvantage in favor of arguments that posit values and attitudes as fundamental to the life chances of the urban, minority poor. In More Than Just Race, Wilson now directly engages the question of structure versus culture, arguing that we cannot ignore cultural influences if we are to understand urban poverty, the disadvantaged plight of poor, urban black men, and the black family (each topic detailed in a chapter). He criticizes his own earlier work for implicitly assuming that culture is merely a ""by-product"" of structural forces, arguing here for some influence of culture in its own right.","10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01183.x","Sociological Forum","Public policy; Political economy; Racism; Sociology; Poverty; Power (social and political); Disadvantaged; Life chances; Argument; Social issues","en",0,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40783401",1037,"Reflected on William Julius Wilson’s work and its relevance to contemporary urban and rural poverty.","Structural shifts in labor markets and neighborhood segregation remain central to understanding persistent poverty.","Strengthen place-based anti-poverty strategies to address spatial and labor market inequalities in both urban and rural settings.","Rural poverty; Urban poverty",NA

In turn, such theories are often tested against the backdrop of factors that regulate the supply of offenders and facilities. We agree that supply and demand factors may be proximate causes of prison population sizes, but that socio‐economic development is central to shaping the larger narrative. In this study, we identify a “criminological Kuznets curve,” whereby the association between incarceration rates and economic development is curvilinear, reaching its peak among middle‐income countries. Drawing from a sample of 680 observations across 111 countries during the 2000 – 2015 period, we find that incarceration is strongly associated with factors rooted in development, including crime rates, the age structure of the population, and democratization. We find that human rights conditions are positively associated with incarceration, which we interpret as a shift away from more severe forms of punishment (e.g., death penalty, torture) as societies modernize. Meanwhile, the effects of several other predictors (government expenditures and income inequality) are conditioned by a country’s level of development. Finally, when adding country fixed effects, we show that economic growth increases prison rates among low‐income countries, but reduces them among affluent nations, which directly contributes to the criminological Kuznets curve. Overall, we conclude that prison populations are shaped by both supply and demand factors, but that development processes help organize these relationships.</jats:p>","10.1111/socf.12683","Sociological Forum","Sociology; Democratization; Iron cage; Prison; Cross national; Criminology","en",8,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/socf.12683",1040,"Investigated how international development practices impact domestic income inequality using cross-national data.","Global development frameworks often reinforce existing inequalities by privileging elite interests.","Revise income poverty interventions to prioritize equitable development outcomes within national contexts.","Income poverty",NA
"548","The Abandoned Promise of Civil Rights","Zulema Valdez",2015,"© 2015 Eastern Sociological Society. Fifty years after the civil rights movement, ethnic and racial disparities persist and have even widened across a number of socioeconomic indicators. When compared against whites, nonwhites today fare about the same or worse than their counterparts of the past in educational and occupational attainment, income and earnings, wealth, unemployment and underemployment. How can we understand the failure of racial and ethnic minority groups to attain socioeconomic parity with non-Hispanic whites following one of the most progressive eras of American race relations? Contemporary economic and political approaches are often considered separately and offer different explanations. What they share in common, however, is a tendency to downplay the salience of race as a significant factor that conditions the life chances of nonwhites in the post-civil rights era. This article introduces a critical race perspective to redirect this conversation. This approach starts from the premise that the social structure of the United States is highly stratified by race, which conditions racially unequal outcomes. In the post-civil rights era, color-blind racism is the hegemonic ideology, discourse, and practice, which justifies persistent racial inequality. The development of a color-blind ideology reflects this historical moment and the larger political and economic context; thus, its development is consistent with the political shift toward neoconservatism and the economic transition to neoliberalism. Taken together, these social forces foster the reproduction of a racialized social system characterized by persistent racial inequality that is observed in the post-civil rights era.","10.1111/socf.12180","Sociological Forum","Ethnic group; Racism; Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Ideology; Underclass; Life chances; Racial formation theory; Development economics; Politics","en",18,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/socf.12180",1043,"Analyzed how the legacy of civil rights movements shaped employment access and equality enforcement.","Civil rights reforms failed to deliver sustained employment equity, especially for marginalized groups.","Strengthen enforcement mechanisms in employment policy to fulfill civil rights-era promises and reduce disparities.","Employment","racial inequality; colorblind racism; underclass; middle class minorities"

In this article, we engage with interview and supplemental survey data from 40 FGLI students at an elite university to demonstrate how self‐advocacy skills—conceptualized as a form of cultural capital—can support FGLI students' transition into college. We do this through the case of pre‐orientation programs, which are increasingly offered across universities, where half of the sample participated in pre‐orientation and half did not. We interviewed both subsets at the start of their first academic year, as well as during their COVID‐19‐induced departure from campus residences. In response, we argue that students who participated in pre‐orientation more often demonstrate self‐advocacy skills, both in‐person and online, especially in comparison with those who did not participate. We show that forming relationships with peers, as well as faculty and staff, during pre‐orientation is key to enacting self‐advocacy.

The program met its goal. The mothers did send their children to school. I argue that only observing this outcome of school access, however, black‐boxes the causal pathway of how mothers sent their children to school in the Egyptian context, and how the program mattered.

Mothers had always managed this expense, using scarce gendered household resources, before, during, and after the program. Through ethnographic, interview, and survey data, this article shows that while the cash—transferred to the mothers and labeled for education—enabled the mothers to send their children to school, the program conditions were unnecessary.

Indeed, populist campaigns that have acquired wide currency in the last few years have been ontologically predicated on the idea that there exists different “truths.” The premise of different truths has debunked any notion of an objective reality by rendering even the most reified of “facts” to be the outcome of individual subjectivities and ideological subscriptions. Donald Trump’s appeal to “fake news,” for instance, captures the implications that emerge when certain material “facts” become delegitimated in the public arena. The obfuscation of material facts through its entanglements in political discourse raises a timely question concerning theoretical resistance: How can objective reality retain its conceptual and analytical ideations without succumbing to the dangers that objective science historically created for socially marginalized subjects?

"553","“Where the Danger Lies”: Race, Gender, and Chinese and Japanese Exclusion in the United States, 1870–19241","Catherine Lee",2010,"Race too often is used as the explanatory variable for understanding immigration exclusion, marginalizing the significance of race making, ethnic differentiation, and gender construction in particular. This article explores these processes by examining exclusionary policies implemented against Chinese and Japanese immigrants from the mid- 1870s to 1924, the year the National Origins Act was passed. Politicians, intellectuals, and moral reformers used a gendered logic - the construction of idealized gender norms, roles, and sexual propriety and the attachment of these meanings to male and female bodies - to distinguish Japanese immigrants from the Chinese immigrants they followed, allowing for ethnic differentiation and dissimilar policies. The convergence toward exclusion rested on a racialized logic - the construction and attachment of inferior status and meanings to immigrant groups through discourse, formal and informal categorization, or social closure - which claimed that the Japanese were unassimilable and racially undesirable like the Chinese. Exclusionists focused on the immigrant women, decrying their sexual and gender impropriety as evidence of the groups' threats to the sanctity of white families, which imperiled the nation. Gender and race both mattered in these logics and their meanings were constructed as their salience interconnected.","10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01175.x","Sociological Forum","Gender studies; Ethnic group; Sociology; Closure (psychology); Salience (language); National identity; Racialization; Appearance of impropriety; Immigration; Race (biology)","en",28,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01175.x",1061,"Investigated how child welfare professionals interpret racial and gender risks in migrant child protection cases.","Racialized and gendered assumptions shaped perceptions of danger, influencing case outcomes for migrant families.","Train child protection workers to reduce bias in migration and poverty policy applications for vulnerable families.","Migration and poverty",NA

Black dancers have been historically excluded and remain severely underrepresented through controlling images, discrimination, and marginalization. As an occupation, ballet demands intensive emotional and aesthetic labor. This research relies on interviews to better understand the experiences of Black women in ballet in context. It specifically examines the ways that Black dancers negotiate two forms of labor that have typically been theorized separately: emotional and aesthetic labor.

Few studies have thus far applied these insights regarding groups’ innovative strategies and their interactions with the state apparatuses to explore individuals’ claims‐making at the microlevel. Based on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork in southwest China, this study analyzes how rural ethnic minority Qiang women actively engage various levels of government officials to demand enhanced social provisions. These women play off stereotypical gender assumptions about them to appear as nonthreatening subjects who accommodate state priorities for poverty alleviation and social stability. They also engage state officials and exploit (not always successfully) the government’s official rhetoric and internal divisions to secure much‐needed social provisions. I call this type of gendered individual claims‐making “rightful bargaining.” Yet, paradoxically, the study also reveals that, because the state’s legitimacy is founded precisely on economic growth and the appearance of popular consent, the incremental material gains these women achieve inadvertently reinforce the authoritarian regime’s overall legitimacy, domination, and control.</jats:p>","10.1111/socf.12723","Sociological Forum","Sociology; Poverty; China; Rural women; Economic growth; Authoritarianism","en",2,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/socf.12723",1064,"Documented rural women’s strategies for negotiating housing access through local power structures.","Women leveraged kinship and informal bargaining to secure basic housing despite insecure land rights.","Prioritize legal housing rights and rural women’s bargaining capacity under housing insecurity policies.","Housing insecurity",NA

In this article, we present data from two separate empirical projects (teaching and learning the pelvic exam in medical schools and feminist anti‐violence counseling programs) in order to theorize what we call “counter‐clinical spaces.” Counter‐clinical spaces are medicalized sites of knowledge production and practice that are produced through social movements’ contestations with biomedicine. Other examples include sexual assault nurse examiner programs, LGBT health centers, and sexual health clinics. Counter‐clinical spaces are “counter” and “clinical” in several ways. First, these spaces are distinctly clinical in that they intervene in the health of the body. Second, these spaces are counter‐clinical in that they are organized in critique of dominant medical practices. Crucially, counter‐clinical spaces engage the clinical encounter as a site of transformation: social movement actors target clinicians’ deployment of medical power, especially in their interactions with marginalized persons. We thus attend to the scale upon which social movements make a change in and against medicine, and we highlight how social movement logics can and do change practices even when they are unable to shift structures.</jats:p>","10.1111/socf.12783","Sociological Forum","Sociology; Social change; Data science; Feminism; Scale (ratio)","en",3,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/socf.12783",1069,"Examined intermediary spaces in which vulnerable communities resist clinical frameworks of climate adaptation.","These counter-clinical spaces offered alternative narratives of healing and resilience rooted in community experience.","Integrate community-led approaches into climate vulnerability strategies to align with lived realities of adaptation.","Climate vulnerability",NA
"557","Why William Julius Wilson Matters","Gregory D. Squires",2010,"The study of race and poverty in the nation's cities has been a central - if not the central - concern of sociology and other social sciences generally for at least three decades. William Julius Wilson can take a large share of the credit for this phenomenon. It is difficult to overstate the profound impact of his scholarship. Perhaps more importantly, he has the ear of people who matter - foundation executives, newspaper editors, and elected officials, including, of course, at least two presidents. What he thinks matters particularly because it influences what so many others in nonacademic worlds think. More Than Just Race extends his line of inquiry, revisiting many (and repeating some) of his earlier arguments. Whether it will have the same impact remains to be determined, but there is one dramatic change from his series of books going back at least to The Declining Significance of Race published in 1978. Wilson no longer emphasizes universalistic approaches to racial inequality. His rejection of a color-blind approach is most provocative at a time when so many are claiming we now live in a post civil rights, color-blind nation. With Obama in the White House and expectations higher in progressive policy circles than at any time in living memory, it may well be that Wilson could matter more than ever before. Perhaps the most important feature of William Julius Wilson's work is his challenge to conventional wisdom that relies on individualistic traits and actions to explain who gets what and why in the United States. Time and again, Wilson has demonstrated the importance of structural and contextual forces at work - some explicitly racial, others arguably with no racial animosity but yielding unequal racial outcomes - and the need for collective responses to preeminently social problems. In previous work he has called for concrete policies to respond to those structural realities: the disappearance of jobs, the need for universal healthcare, the shortage of effective schools. The agenda is far less ambitious in this book. The overriding message of More Than Just Race is the importance of ""framing."" And this is its most important limitation. Many familiar themes run throughout this book. Most salient is an ongoing commentary on the intersection of culture and structure. Wilson emphasizes the importance of taking culture and behavior seriously and chastises those who criticize such work as victim-blaming. He repeats the debate over Moynihan's report ""The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,"" with which readers of his earlier books are quite familiar, but he is quick to assert that culture is rooted in structural realities and that structure","10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01185.x","Sociological Forum","Positive economics; Racism; Sociology; Framing (social sciences); Individualism; Poverty; Law; Scholarship; Conventional wisdom; Phenomenon; Social issues","en",0,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01185.x",1076,"Reflected on the enduring relevance of William Julius Wilson’s research in explaining structural poverty.","Wilson’s work continues to frame the analysis of race, deindustrialization, and spatial inequality.","Use intersectional poverty frameworks to update and apply Wilson’s insights in contemporary policy design.","Intersectional poverty",NA

This article instead explores its negative potential. The authors focus on the relationship between different forms of community-level social capital and tax avoidance by wealthy Americans, using data from the Panama Papers leaks to analyze the residential communities of Americans who engaged in offshore tax avoidance. The analysis demonstrates, first, that communities with more civic organizations are more likely to have tax avoiders. This finding suggests that civic organizations may promote cohesion among wealthy elites, producing insular attitudes and deviance. Second, income inequality correlates with tax avoidance, indicating that highly unequal communities have more insular elites. Finally, more patriotic communities have lower tax avoidance.

Data come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its Child Development Supplement on children ages 3 to 17 years observed between 2002 and 2019. The authors use linear mixed-effects models to investigate the associations among NWP, IP, and four cognitive and behavioral outcomes. NWP reduces children's cognitive scores and was associated with increases in both problem behavior scores. Negative associations for NWP are similar in magnitude to those found for IP. Much of the NWP effect operates through asset deprivation rather than high debt.

Activists decried this injustice and pressured legislators to introduce new practices and procedures. Since the passage of these initiatives in the 1960s, scholars have repeatedly documented ongoing racial inequality in housing at large. Yet rarely have researchers investigated whether racial inequality persists within governmentally subsidized housing units. By merging the restricted American Housing Survey with the American Community Survey at a Federal Statistical Research Data Center, the authors find that low-income renter subsidies are effective and beneficial but disproportionately grant White residents access to cheaper and higher quality units. Moreover, subsidized renters remain racially segregated across program type and neighborhoods.

In recent decades, however, notions regarding the equality or inequality of our society have progressively taken on a more political nature. Consequently, people’s perceptions of income inequality may be less associated with their actual income status and more with their political ideology. The authors visualize this “political turn” using data from the U.S. General Social Survey (1987–2021). The analysis shows that historically actual income and perceived inequality had an inverse relationship, independent of political alignment. Yet since 2000, this has changed: whereas Republicans show a deepening inverse correlation after some attenuation in prior years, Democrats reverse it. With this said, we see an increase in overall concern about inequality among those who identify strongly with either Democratic or Republican ideologies, but importantly the biggest increase is among those in the Democratic group.

Yet research shows that inequality reduces participation among groups likely to support the radical right and promotes support for redistribution, an issue championed by the radical left. This raises questions about why, if at all, inequality matters for radical-right politics. The author reconciles previous arguments by developing a theory that connects these phenomena through the process of boundary consolidation. He argues that inequality generates status threats that prompt exclusionary shifts in national group boundaries. This promotes ethnonationalism, a restrictive conception of national membership and, ultimately, support for the radical right, whose mobilization relies on ethnonationalist appeals. Analyses of time-series cross-sectional data from 38 countries support this theory, revealing that inequality is associated with greater ethnonationalism, with distinct associations by income and ethnicity, and that ethnonationalism strongly predicts radical-right voting. The author thus demonstrates how long-term structural changes are linked to contemporary radical politics and how arguments setting economic and cultural causes of the radical right in opposition are inadequate. </jats:p>","10.1177/23780231241251714","Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World","Radical right; Opposition (politics); Voting; Inequality; Politics; Political radicalism; Consolidation (business); Redistribution (election); Ethnic group; Political economy; Political science; Economics; Sociology; Demographic economics; Law; Mathematics; Accounting; Mathematical analysis","en",0,"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23780231241251714",1136,"Investigated how income inequality shapes political boundary-making and group consolidation.","Higher inequality led to more rigid political identities, reinforcing polarization and exclusion.","Revise income poverty strategies to address the social fragmentation caused by economic divides.","Income poverty",NA

How did policy makers justify welfare expansion? The author conducts an analysis of the parliamentary debates that resulted in the implementation of these programs in Mexico (1997) and Peru (2005). By examining the policy makers’ reasoning behind these programs, the author aims to explore the relationship between new forms of social rights and citizenship. The findings show that state actors mobilized narratives of nation-building to justify the historical debt to specific segments of the population, shared an ambivalence regarding the meaning of cash transfers between entitlements or investments, and acknowledged the precarity of the funding scheme. </jats:p>","10.1177/23780231231222117","Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World","Citizenship; Framing (construction); Political economy; Democratization; Population; Welfare; Workfare; Welfare reform; Social policy; Welfarism; Ambivalence; Debt; Political science; Social citizenship; Precarity; Sociology; Economics; Democracy; Law; Politics; Social psychology; Finance; Psychology; Demography; Structural engineering; Engineering","en",0,"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23780231231222117",1144,"Analyzed how different framings of welfare—citizenship, collectivity, and deservingness—affect public support for expansion.","Support for welfare was highest when framed as collective responsibility and lowest when framed through individual blame.","Reframe social protection messaging to emphasize shared citizenship and reduce stigma toward recipients.","Employment; Social protection",NA

In addition, using discourse analysis we examine the redefinition of race-targeting policies from being a social remedy into being a current social problem. We collected interview and questionnaire data from a sample of 310 students and faculty at a predominantly white university, regarding their attitude toward race- and income-targeted social policies in the United States. We find that the majority of respondents who oppose race-targeting policies (1) frame racial discrimination as a problem of the past; (2) define race-targeting as a subversion of meritocracy; and therefore, (3) devalue programs that seek to provide differential opportunity to those groups that have been structurally disadvantaged in American society. We conclude that the “American stratification ethos” can be employed for disadvantaging purposes.","10.2307/1389780","Sociological Perspectives","Gender studies; Racism; Sociology; Reverse discrimination; Ethos; Subversion; Disadvantaged; Meritocracy; Social issues; Discourse analysis","en",50,"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1389780",1163,"Analyzed how white Americans discuss race in the context of poverty and social hierarchy.","White narratives often deflected structural critiques, reinforcing racialized notions of deservingness.","Revise intersectional poverty messaging to confront and reshape dominant racial narratives.","Intersectional poverty",NA

These differences have been attributed to inequalities in social and health conditions. The historically greater rate of black childlessness has been treated as the result of pathological sterility or pregnancy loss due to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), malnutrition, and inadequate medical care. Conversely, white childlessness has been viewed as the product of decisions to be child-free, facilitated or encouraged by such things as prolonged schooling, the sex-role revolution, and effective contraception. Yet it is suggested that childlessness in both races has been shaped by the same basic factors, including social mobility, birth control, and changing family norms. Moreover, as a result of socioeconomic gains by blacks, patterns of marital childlessness by race are becoming alike, and voluntary childlessness may be growing among blacks as well as whites.","10.2307/1389096","Sociological Perspectives","Socioeconomic status; Demography; Psychology; Childlessness; Voluntary childlessness; Birth control; Social mobility; Inequality; Malnutrition; Race (biology)","en",32,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1389096",1164,"Explored racial disparities in childlessness using long-term U.S. demographic data.","Black women were more likely to remain childless involuntarily, often tied to poverty and systemic barriers.","Target reproductive and economic health policy to address involuntary childlessness in marginalized groups.","Food insecurity",NA

In contrast to quantitative analyses, which have found robust and positive outcomes associated with college attainment, I use ethnographic methods to tell a more complicated story about what college offers the poor. This story centers on a low-income woman of color named Angelica. Angelica’s story of drug-addict-turned college graduate suggests that college might be just as much a regulatory institution as a poverty solution. To this extent, it critically assesses my role as Angelica’s former professor, professional mentor, and life narrator. The article situates the expansion of higher education and Angelica’s pathway into college in late twentieth-century efforts to reform the welfare system and reduce state-sponsored social safety nets.

Using data from the 1997 and 1999 National Survey of American Families, this article investigates the effects of participation in paid work for low-income single-parent female-headed families on three important aspects of family well-being: (1) the ability to pay for rent and utilities, (2) postponing needed medical care, and (3) food hardship. Results indicate that full-time employment does not “pay off” for families who have been off welfare for two or more years when compared to families who have never relied on welfare.

We argue that this disagreement is an artifact of study designs. Researchers usually study either the totality of a state’s social expenditures or one specific program. These approaches overlook the fact that individual social programs were born of different circumstances and serve different constituencies. Comparing state-level policies for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), our findings suggest that these programs are governed by distinct logics of redistribution. Racial characteristics drive TANF generosity. Economic forces best predict CHIP generosity. SNAP generosity is a function of political factors.

Using data from the 1994 and 2002 International Social Survey Program, the authors explore support for and determinants of paid maternity leave and financial benefits for childcare.

Threats to life expectancy in less-developed nations include poverty, warfare, intense hunger, and disease, particularly AIDS/ HIV. This article utilizes structural equation models for a sample of less- developed nations and a subsample of Sub-Saharan African nations to test interrelationships among predictors. Findings indicate modernization to be the most robust predictor of life expectancy across less-developed nations and HIV to be the strongest determinant of life expectancy in Sub-Saharan African nations. Somewhat surprisingly, warfare and hunger do not have direct impacts on life expectancy among less-developed nations; however, important linkages among warfare, hunger, and disease are evidenced in the Sub-Saharan African sample, along with a notable positive influence of modernization on HIV rates.

It is hypothesized that the effect of dependency on inequality is mediated by its effect on the uneven development of the productive capacities of a nation.

A Class Perspective","Edward Haddon; Cary Wu",2021,"<jats:p> While some scholars suggest that awareness of income inequality is strongest when the actual level of inequality is high, others find that individuals’ awareness of income inequality is largely unresponsive to actual inequality. In this article, we argue that individuals in different social class positions often respond to the actual levels of income inequality distinctively, and therefore a class perspective is essential in understanding how actual inequality and people’s perceptions of it are associated. Using data from the social inequality modules of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP, 1992, 1999, and 2009) as well as the World Income Inequality Database ( https://www.wider.unu.edu/ ) and the World Inequality Database ( https://wid.world/ ), we consider how actual inequality interacts with social class to shape people’s perceptions of income inequality across 64 country-years between 1992 and 2009. We find that overall, perceptions of inequality are higher among the working class and lower among salariats. However, cross-nationally and over time, as the actual level of inequality increases, working classes become less critical toward inequality, whereas salariats become more critical. The actual level of inequality itself has no impact on people’s discontent toward it. This creates a counterbalancing effect that obscures the aggregate relationship between rising inequality and people’s perceptions of it. </jats:p>","10.1177/07311214211062106","Sociological Perspectives","Inequality; Social inequality; Income inequality metrics; Economic inequality; Social class; Perspective (graphical); Demographic economics; Perception; Sociology; Economics; Psychology; Mathematics; Mathematical analysis; Geometry; Neuroscience; Market economy","en",4,"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/07311214211062106",1218,"Tested how perceived versus actual income inequality shape individual beliefs and behaviors.","Misperceptions of inequality reduced support for redistribution and misdirected resentment.","Improve public understanding of inequality to increase support for poverty reduction measures.","Income poverty",NA

Data are drawn from the F.B.I.'s Supplementary Homicide Reports and aggregated for 131 SMSAs over the 1976-1984 period. Un- like previous research, two out-groups-white and black offenders-are considered to see if the same predictors behave similarly for the different out-groups. As expected, the descriptive data show that Asian Americans as a minority group have a greater conditional probability of being killed by out-group members than do whites and blacks. On the other hand, logistic regression analysis reveals that educational inequality and population size are significant predictors of the conditional probability of out-group victim- ization, while hypotheses concerning the effects of relative group size, income inequality, and residential segregation fail to be fully supported.

This article is a case study of low-income rural Whites' personal interpretations of health and income inequalities with a concern for understanding the potential effectiveness of a community action program (CAP) designed to enhance their critical literacy. Findings reveal that low-income rural Whites predominantly use ideologies of individualism to interpret the inequalities experienced by others, they employ a pseudostructural level analysis tempered by individualism to interpret their experience of health and income inequalities, and they respond collectively along racial and national lines when considering overall inequalities. Based on these findings, I provide suggestions on how CAPs can more effectively elevate the critical literacy of low-income rural Whites.","10.1525/sop.2007.50.1.79","Sociological Perspectives","Sociological imagination; Sociology; Ideology; Individualism; Narrative; Critical literacy; Social change; Working poor; Inequality; Social psychology","en",3,"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/sop.2007.50.1.79",1223,"Studied the impact of critical literacy skills on working-poor individuals’ ability to navigate systems and advocate for change.","Stronger critical literacy correlated with higher civic engagement and institutional navigation.","Expand adult education programs focused on critical literacy to empower the working poor.","Education access; Health disparities; Income poverty",NA

It also argues that capitalist markets normally generate unemployment, which sustains poverty; capitalist nations in Europe with less poverty don't have better free markets but their governments pay needy people more. These facts were invisible in the U.S. because the right framed the poverty debate. Because of the weakness of democratic socialism and because liberalism was not very radical, there was little opposition.

However, how and why unemployment and benefit receipt increases the risk of partnership dissolution remains the subject of much debate. In recent policy discourse, financial differentials in benefit entitlement between lone and couple parents are said to encourage intact couples to separate. Based on in-depth, face-to-face interviews with a group of low-income mothers who had been partnered prior to claiming lone parent benefits, this paper explores whether benefit entitlement or receipt influenced the decision to separate or divorce. The research found that more salient to partnership dissolution than the amount of benefits a couple may have been entitled to, was who had access to the money, how it was managed and how it was spent. To the extent that welfare systems influence which member of a couple has access to household income, the design and administration of benefits was having an important contributory effect.

The main findings suggest some positive effect of the BF on human development. However, the BF programme should be more integrated with the education and the health system to ameliorate the advancement of human rights.

Nelson",2007,"ABSTRACT This paper draws on two projects by the author to draw some general conclusions about ongoing challenges in the understanding of poverty. In the first project, the author examined the survival strategies of married couple families in a rural county and concluded that access to good work enabled enrichment of those strategies. In the second project, located in the same rural county, the author concluded that single mothers were less able than the members of married couples to engage in enrichment activities and drew more heavily on others for survival. Drawing on these comparative data, the author then argues first, that research should focus more fully on the broad variety of ways in which the members of communities make ends meet in order to understand the relative poverty of those unable to engage in a varied survival strategy, and second, that research must also examine the consequences of social support for those who give as well as for those who receive it.","10.1300/j134v10n04_05","Journal of Poverty","Rural area; Variety (cybernetics); Sociology; Work (electrical); Poverty; Social support; Rural poverty; Single mothers; Economic growth; Social Welfare","en",7,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v10n04_05",1494,"Reviewed persistent conceptual and measurement issues in rural poverty research globally.","Definitions of rural poverty vary widely, impeding cross-study comparisons and policy translation.","Standardize rural poverty definitions in monitoring frameworks to strengthen policy relevance and international comparability.","Rural poverty",NA

Given this, this essay suggests that instead of asking, how has welfare policy changed over time and why? as we have typically done, we might be better served as scholars and as activists by asking, how has the experience of being poor and in need of assistance changed over time? By doing that—by allowing the objects of policy to evaluate it, by making room for them to describe their own experience and then taking that “life knowledge” seriously, and by understanding this as expertise—a different story emerges, and a new kind of American welfare state history may be revealed.","10.1080/10875540802198685","Journal of Poverty","Welfare; Welfare state; Political economy; Sociology; Poverty; Social policy; Welfare reform; Blindness; Development economics","en",1,"https://scholars.unh.edu/unhmbusiness_facpub/10/",1522,"Critiqued the disconnect between elite narratives and actual experiences of poverty using historical and policy analysis.","Poverty was often minimized in policy debates, contributing to ineffective and stigmatizing welfare programs.","Reframe social protection discourse to reflect lived experiences and dismantle stigma in policy design.","Social protection",NA

The Kenya National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) is a government social protection programme established in September 2013 as part of the government’s initiative to improve and enhance social protection and improve the welfare of the poor household particularly at the grass root. This study therefore aimed at analyzing the impact of devolved social safety funds on household welfare in Kenya.&#x0D;
Methodology: The study employed a non-experimental pooled cross-sectional research design. Cross-sectional data was collected from selected households using a structured questionnaire. The study targeted a population of 1,128,693 households lifted from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (2015/2016). Fisher's formula was used in sample selection, where a sample of 384 respondents was selected.  A multivariate regression model was used to analyze data. Inferential and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data acquired in the research.&#x0D;
Findings: The findings revealed that devolved Social Safety funds significantly and positively influence household welfare in Kenya. Most beneficiaries under study, particularly the elderly recorded a greater improvement in their welfare.&#x0D;
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Given the findings, it is recommended that the government of Kenya should increase the flow of these funds to target a larger proportion of the rural households.

There is much criticism of the current system – from the bedroom tax to the benefits cap, and sanctions to work capability assessments – plus detailed analysis such as Spicker’s (2017) What’s wrong with social security benefits? Projections by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others show that recent changes to benefits will contribute to increases in already high levels of poverty e.g. the Joseph Rowntree Foundation forecasts there will be 1.2 million more children in poverty by 2020. Not only this, but debate on the topic has become highly politicised and divisive, being described as ‘angry and fruitless’ (Unwin, 2013) and ‘toxic’ (Lister, 2016). 

Given the politicised nature of the issue, there is potential for civil society to play a leading role in moving debate on. Research (Orton, 2016) has found, however, that there is a lack of agreement even within civil society on ways forward. The research identified that on some issues e.g. housing, Early Childhood Education and Care and minimum wage levels, there is considerable consensus (within civil society) as to what needs to be done and some detailed plans for how to do it. But on the core issue of social security in relation to income that is not the case; there is apparent lack of agreement about ways forward and certainly no detailed plans as exist for other fields. Saying there is little agreement is not to suggest an absence of ideas. There are strong advocates of a n unconditional universal Basic or Citizen’s Income while others express preference for contribution - based entitlements or universal but means - tested benefits. There are different views on the importance that should be given to public services versus individual income support measures or whether to prioritise immediate issues such as the bedroom tax or longer - term changes to Universal Credit and the tax system more generally. 

This article reports on a project that sought to redress this by using a solutions - focused approach with emphasis on building consensus. Supported by a small grant from the Social Policy Association, the project consisted of eight deliberative workshops which tackled a very specific question: What practical, concrete steps can be taken to put the security back into social security in the short to medium term?

In the 1980s and '90s employers slashed their workforces and the Federal Reserve Board often restrained economic growth to keep prices and wages from climbing too rapidly. Meanwhile, welfare reform cured little poverty and added millions to an already flooded labor pool. While it is well known that highly publicized monthly unemployment rates underestimate real joblessness, this article highlights previously ignored populations. It suggests that there is an iron law that American leaders resist growth that would eliminate unemployment and push official poverty rates below the 11 % levels reached in the 1970s and the year 2000.

As poverty is measured by income, it is logically linked to inadequate wages. Movements to establish a “living wage,” intended to ensure self-sufficiency, have also been pursued. The histories of these efforts are briefly examined, with attention to the working poor. The authors argue that using a living wage benchmark for measuring income inadequacy should replace poverty measures to better describe a continuum from the poorest households to those who have achieved at least minimal self-sufficiency.","10.1080/10875549.2012.747997","Journal of Poverty","Economics; Culture of poverty; Poverty; Working poor; Living wage; Argument; Development economics; Self-sufficiency","en",12,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10875549.2012.747997",1560,"Critically assessed poverty targeting in rural anti-poverty programs in the U.S., arguing that many miss key populations.","Programs often served the moderately poor while neglecting the most deprived due to narrow eligibility rules.","Revise rural poverty eligibility thresholds to reach the most excluded and severely disadvantaged.","Income poverty; Rural poverty",NA

Specialist surveys have been developed to measure and profile these phenomena, but these remain separate from the mainstream statistical approach to poverty, which relies heavily on large-scale household surveys. Evidence from recent work in this area, including qualitative evidence, is very suggestive of risk and driving factors, but it is difficult to weigh the relative importance of different factors or to predict the effects of policy measures. A composite survey approach is developed, linking a specialised survey targeting households at risk of destitution with a major national household panel dataset, to enable predictive models to be fitted to data including significant representation of hard-to-reach and non-household populations. Models predicting destitution and food bank usage are developed and compared, highlighting the roles of key factors. Vignettes are used to show how the risks vary dramatically between households in different situations. The potential role of such models in micro-simulation or prediction of impacts of different scenarios is discussed.</jats:p>","10.1332/175982721x16649700901023","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Poverty; Context (archaeology); Mainstream; Austerity; Public economics; Welfare; Economics; Work (physics); Development economics; Economic growth; Political science; Geography; Engineering; Politics; Market economy; Mechanical engineering; Archaeology; Law","en",2,"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/downloadpdf/journals/jpsj/31/1/article-p5.pdf",1564,"Identified overlooked forms of poverty in the UK using qualitative interviews and innovative measurement tools.","Standard poverty metrics missed chronic and extreme deprivation, particularly in housing and nutrition.","Expand social protection measurement to capture hidden poverty and inform targeted interventions.","Social protection",NA

Consistency in enforcing prostitution laws, which includes laws against patronizing prostitutes, nonetheless, has been and continues to be inequitable. The female prostitute or sex worker continues to be the target of enforcement strategies, while the illegal activities of the sex buyer are minimized or completely ignored.

The Household Calorie Acquisition (HCA) is used to measure the diet quantity aspect of food insecurity, and 225 kg/year/AE is used as a food security threshold. The Household Diet Diversity Score (HHDDS) is used to measure the diet quality aspect of food insecurity, and consuming four food groups is used as a food security line. Approximately 83 per cent of the total households achieved minimum food security status in terms of diet quantity, and 64 per cent were food secure in terms of diet quality. Determinants of food security in terms of diet quantity and quality were analysed using Tobit and logit regression models, respectively. Sex, family size, farm size, number of oxen, expenditure on agricultural technology, agroecology zone and distance from market centre are statistically significant determinants of food security in terms of diet quantity. On the other hand, sex, education status, off-farming activities, livestock ownership and agroecology zone are statistically significant determinants of food security in terms of diet quality or diversity. The study suggested the urgency of human capital development, increasing the production and productivity of major cereal crops, and promoting labour-intensive rural employment opportunities to break the vicious circle of poverty and food insecurity. It also suggested the promotion of soil and water conservation, livestock rearing and the use of organic fertiliser in highland areas, while mechanised farming for major crops such as rice, onion, chickpea, tomato and garlic is recommended for midland areas.</jats:p>","10.1332/175982721x16760300561102","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Food security; Tobit model; Livestock; Agriculture; Agroecology; Poverty; Productivity; Agricultural economics; Geography; Socioeconomics; Agricultural science; Economics; Economic growth; Biology; Archaeology; Forestry; Econometrics","en",6,"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/downloadpdf/journals/jpsj/aop/article-10.1332-175982721X16760300561102/article-10.1332-175982721X16760300561102.pdf",1585,"Assessed rural household food security and its determinants in Ethiopia through household survey analysis.","Access to land, off-farm income, and education were key factors improving food security.","Prioritize food insecurity programs that promote land access and education in rural regions.","Food insecurity",NA

Using the 2020 Youth Survey in Barcelona, this cross-sectional study provides novel data on the prevalence and the factors associated with menstrual poverty in an urban context (Barcelona) in a high-income country (Spain) with a randomly selected representative sample of 700 young women aged 15 to 34. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used in the analysis. Results show that 15.3 per cent of young women in Barcelona reported facing financial barriers to accessing menstrual products. Further, those young women with a high level of material deprivation (OR=4.42; CI=2.14–9.16) have a greater probability of suffering from menstrual poverty, whereas those living independently from their parents (OR=0.50; CI=0.28–0.90) and women with a non-EU origin (Latin-Americans: OR=0.54; CI=0.31–0.93; Others: OR=0.06; CI=0.01–0.46) have a lower probability of reporting menstrual poverty. Our findings advocate that the measurement of poverty should consider individual aspects and needs, and not only the household income level as the reference. Further, we would encourage rethinking poverty measurement with a gender perspective, as well as identifying how deprivations overlap to aggravate the experience of poverty.</jats:p>","10.1332/175982721x16684429255213","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Poverty; Context (archaeology); Logistic regression; Descriptive statistics; Cross-sectional study; Demography; Household income; Socioeconomics; Young adult; Latin Americans; Geography; Environmental health; Medicine; Psychology; Gerontology; Political science; Sociology; Economics; Economic growth; Statistics; Mathematics; Archaeology; Pathology; Internal medicine; Law","en",1,"https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/207706/1/255286.pdf",1586,"Surveyed the prevalence and effects of menstrual poverty among young women in rural areas.","Lack of access to menstrual products led to school absenteeism, shame, and health issues.","Integrate menstrual health support into rural poverty policies to promote gender equity in education and health.","Rural poverty",NA

Lewandowski",2008,"ABSTRACT Among social scientists, development theorists, and policy makers there is today an emergent consensus about the multidimensional and contextual character of poverty. Working within the framework of such a consensus in this article, I attempt to identify the social dimension of human poverty. Most generally, I try to sketch an account of social poverty as a shared normative (or soft) constraint on human action and interaction. The argument is developed as follows. I begin by summarizing and then using social capital theory to characterize my account of social poverty more fully. Here I distinguish between what I call horizontal social capital (networks of social trust and connections that are accessible and appropriable within a specific socioeconomic or cultural stratum) and vertical social capital (networks of social trust and connections that are accessible and appropriable between and among various socioeconomic and cultural strata). I argue that social poverty is an absence or scarcity of ve...","10.1080/10875540801967908","Journal of Poverty","Positive economics; Social entropy; Social position; Sociology; Culture of poverty; Social reproduction; Social change; Social mobility; Social stratification; Economic growth; Social transformation","en; ja",22,"http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40020185340",1587,"Proposed a new concept of 'social poverty' emphasizing deficits in relationships, inclusion, and dignity.","Social isolation and exclusion were widespread among the poor, exacerbating material deprivation.","Incorporate dignity and social inclusion goals into child poverty and development frameworks.","Child poverty",NA

Women on welfare, however, will accomplish self-sufficiency only when the jobs available to them pay high enough wages to pull them and their families out of poverty. This study, using multiple regression analyses on data from the Family Income Study (FIS), examines factors that account for wage levels of women workers who are at risk of requiring public assistance. The findings show that for many women workers income from their jobs alone is not sufficient to support their families.

This behavioral view of poor people is ensconced in the adoption of welfare reform nationally, and many states including Massachusetts, where “work-first” frenzy fed the political momentum for moving families off welfare as quickly as possible, regardless of the consequences for children and families. A study of the experiences of 100 Latina women in Massachusetts during the fall of 1999 and the spring of 2000 shows that welfare reform presents major obstacles for poor women seeking employment as a way out of poverty. These obstacles include three key problems: the lack of information about potential employment and training programs and services; unaccountable discretion on the part of caseworkers; and biased perceptions about Latina women on public assistance.","10.1300/j134v08n01_02","Journal of Poverty","Welfare; Public policy; Economics; Poverty; Welfare reform; Social protection; Discretion; Seeking employment; Economic growth; Politics","en",7,"http://www.tufts.edu/~jjenni02/pdf/welfare-reform.pdf",1589,"Critically analyzed the 'welfare-to-work' model and its role in redefining social safety nets in the U.S.","Work requirements often failed to lift recipients out of poverty and imposed undue burdens.","Dismantle punitive welfare-to-work models and prioritize voluntary, supportive social protection pathways.","Social protection","Welfare to work; welfare reform; Latina women; Massachusetts"

Less well publicized is the economic fate of these “welfare leavers.” Extensive evidence shows that, despite the fact that as many as 60% exit with a full-time job, within a year or two approximately one half of all welfare leavers—and their children—fall into poverty. These findings predate the current severe recession; the economic status of current and past welfare leavers is undoubtedly much worse today. The proximate cause of this high rate of poverty is that welfare leavers end up working, on average, too few hours over the course of a year. Behind these low hours are the more fundamental causes of the measurable “barriers to work” limiting many leavers, and the limited supply of appropriate private-sector jobs, even during the so-called full-employment years of the ...","10.1080/10875549.2011.563169","Journal of Poverty","Welfare; Moral responsibility; Proximate and ultimate causation; Labour economics; Socioeconomic status; Economics; Work (electrical); Poverty; Recession; Welfare reform","en",4,"http://npc.umich.edu/publications/u/working_paper10-03.pdf",1600,"Analyzed the promises of the 1996 U.S. welfare reform in terms of work, responsibility, and self-sufficiency.","Reform outcomes fell short, especially for families with barriers to employment or care responsibilities.","Redesign social protection to support diverse family structures and realistic work expectations.","Social protection",NA

The major findings were that (1) income inequality among children increased at a faster rate than among adult and elderly groups, whether it was measured at the pretransfer stage or the posttransfer stage, and (2) the increased income inequality among children was due, in part, to the declining effectiveness of public income transfers-especially social insurance benefits-in lessening income inequality among children.","10.1300/j134v04n03_01","Journal of Poverty","Redistribution of income and wealth; Economics; Poverty; Social policy; Social protection; Social insurance; Population; Demographic economics; Inequality; Economic growth; Economic inequality","en",5,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v04n03_01",1616,"Assessed trends in income inequality among children in the U.S. over several decades using Census data.","Child income inequality widened significantly, particularly among racial and geographic lines.","Prioritize child-focused income poverty interventions to curb deepening generational inequality.","Income poverty",NA

Thirty-six percent of these individuals were classified as chronic drug users. Significant increases in employment rates and significant decreases in rates of TANF receipt were seen in both groups, but employment was significantly higher in the non-users. While hours worked and earnings increased over time, both non-users and chronic users who become employed are working less than full time and may be earning less than needed to overcome poverty.

Within the federal restrictions, however, states have been granted considerable latitude concerning immigrants. In Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid, the major benefit programs for low-income children, states are authorized to determine whether these programs are to be provided to immigrant families. First, this study examines variations in immigrant provisions across states in Medicaid, TANF, and state health care programs. Second, the study estimates the impact of state immigrant provisions in those programs on the uninsured among children of immigrants. Using the 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS), the study finds that state-funded Medicaid and state health care programs made available to ineligible immigrants (under PRWORA) significantly decrease the risk of being uninsured for children of immigrants, while controlling all other socio-economic-geographical variables.

The power of their language to shape and inform policy is significant in our society. Those who hold power use language to mold and rationalize public policies. From a critical theory perspective, examination of the use of language by those in power to set norms, disempower, and marginalize those people who are nondominant is vital to effect social change. This research critically examines the speeches given on the floor of the House of Representatives prior to the final vote of PRWORA on July 31, 1996, to identify the power of language.

Jindra; Michael Jindra",2016,"ABSTRACTThis article highlights how one nonprofit organization deals with the controversial issue of culture and poverty through its interactions with low-income individuals. Through interviews and participant observation, we analyze its curriculum and process, which focuses on helping participants become more reflexive by analyzing their past life and potential futures through a social class analysis. At the same time, we discuss a key theoretical debate over culture and action/agency. Specifically, we examine the distinction between practical and discursive consciousness (or declarative and non-declarative culture), and issues of agency. We show how this theoretical process is accomplished in the organization by providing people with the opportunity to change their habits, skills, “cultured capacities” and “repertoires,” which can help them get out of poverty. We also show other factors, such as social support, are crucial and how the overall process works more for some than for others.","10.1080/10875549.2016.1204644","Journal of Poverty","Social class; Reflexivity; Agency (sociology); Sociology; Sociology of culture; Culture of poverty; Poverty; Participant observation; Action (philosophy); Social science; Public relations","en",6,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10875549.2016.1204644",1631,"Proposed a theoretical framework connecting poverty, cultural context, and cognitive development.","Cognitive outcomes were shaped not only by material deprivation but also by social and cultural environments.","Design intersectional income poverty interventions that address cognitive and cultural dimensions of child development.","Income poverty; Intersectional poverty","Cultural sociology; poverty; poverty alleviation; social justice; case study"

The HCV program serves to promote economically mixed neighborhoods (deconcentration), residential mobility among the recipients, and desegregation. This study evaluates the locational outcomes of the HCV program recipients in Columbus, Ohio from 1999–2005 against the program's policy goals of deconcentration and desegregation by examining the change in poverty and change in racial composition from pre to post-move neighborhoods. The results reveal that the mobility of recipients does not predict a change in poverty and a recipient's race does not predict a change in racial composition in neighborhoods.

Subsequently, we will make the case for understanding the social and political discourse surrounding the proposal and passage of TANF in light of the more traditional Protestant ethic.

The costs of a child are derived from a loneparent and two-parent family budget standard (minimum income standard). The items in the child’s basket of goods and services include food, clothing, household goods and services, personal care, transport and cultural and social participation necessities. The costs vary by age and according to whether childcare costs are included. Excluding childcare costs, the cost of a child increases with age, varying between £77 per week for 0- to one-year-olds to £116 per week for a secondary school child. There are some economies of scale for families with more than one child. These estimates are used to assess the modified Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equivalence scale and the adequacy of the contribution of the state in child benefits and child tax credits. The state contributes only part of the total costs of a child in low-income families, which means that these costs may have to be met out of the adult benefits.</jats:p>","10.1332/175982711x574003","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Economics; Low income; Demographic economics","en",9,"http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&issn=1759-8273&volume=19&issue=2&spage=131",1655,"Calculated the actual costs of raising a child in a low-income UK household using budget standards.","Costs often exceeded available welfare support, leading to persistent child poverty.","Raise income poverty benefits for families with children to reflect real living expenses.","Income poverty",NA

Five main themes emerge: stability, agency, and control; ideal home life; values about the home; aspirations for children; and obstacles to achieving dreams. In brief, the authors find that the low-income participants in our research have dreams that individuals and families who are more affluent might take for granted and that they appear to adopt neoliberal assumptions about achieving those dreams.

Drawing upon a small-scale, qualitative, client-centered research project and an ongoing advocacy project, it argues that restrictive formal welfare education policy in Michigan is narrowed further by front-line agency workers in both the Family Independence Agency and the Work First program, as agency staff reproduce rigid work-first messages, reproduce organizational cultures of suspicion towards clients, marginalize education and training provisions to simplify their workloads, respond to contracting imperatives, and improvise within deregulated administrative structures.

The survey revealed that even single mothers receiving welfare benefits tended not to perceive poverty as an immediate issue, but rather to see it as a more marginal issue, i.e., as “someone's” problem “somewhere.” Major factors behind the hesitation in directly calling for broader attention to their own problems included the following: (1) not having the time in their daily lives, (2) bias in the information they get, (3) the lack of direct connection between policy and their lives, and (4) not knowing who to call out to. In addition to feeling a sense of resignation and the sense that they have no choice but to treat their problem as a matter of personal responsibility, it was also found that the women had unconsciously developed coping strategies and attitudes designed to avoid criticism from those around them, such as ...","10.1300/j134v11n03_04","Journal of Poverty","Welfare; Moral responsibility; Feeling; Sociology; Poverty; Perception; Public assistance; Single mothers; Social psychology; Criticism","en; ja",7,"http://altmetrics.ceek.jp/article/ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40019928405",1678,"Reviewed global poverty identification practices and their impact on targeting effectiveness.","Many systems misclassify the poor, excluding eligible households due to outdated or narrow criteria.","Improve social protection targeting mechanisms by using multidimensional poverty indicators.","Social protection",NA

Seipel",2009,"Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its companion legislation opened up economic opportunities for minorities, women, and other low-income workers, in reality few received meaningful economic benefits from the civil rights approach alone. Data seem to indicate that many of these workers are still lagging behind and facing increased economic insecurity. To rectify the problem, this article calls for adopting “silver rights” legislation for low-income workers in the coming years. “Silver rights” legislation focuses on economic opportunities for low-income workers and proposes establishing a fairer income distribution in the employment setting through (a) redesigning wage structures, (b) health provisions, (c) pension reform, and (d) tax reform.","10.1080/10875540903272348","Journal of Poverty","Labour economics; Economics; Social policy; Injustice; Legislation; Wage; Pension; Economic growth; Economic inequality; Income distribution; Tax reform","en",0,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10875540903272348",1681,"Evaluated civil rights-based economic legislation aimed at reducing poverty among African Americans.","Policies that addressed economic injustice alongside civil rights improved access to education and jobs.","Integrate equity-focused reforms into income poverty strategies to address racial economic disparities.","Income poverty",NA

Preventive health care in particular is less likely to be afforded to those persons who are members of socioeconomically dis-advantaged and minority groups. One specific inequality in health status and preventive health care, immunization against infectious diseases, currently presents challenges. The inadequate immunization of children, especially those in low income families, is a major public health problem in the United States. The human and financial costs of this problem are great; the consequences are highly preventable. The following discussion delineates and discusses obstacles to the adequate immunization of preschool age children. It highlights policy initiatives and program developments designed to improve rates of immunization.

At the same time that women are being pulled into these low-paying and often inflexible and unstable jobs, reforms in the welfare system have removed the economic safety net for many women and children. This paper relies on in-depth interviews with rural low-income mothers in a midwestern state to examine the importance of the context of working conditions in shaping job turnover. In the often brittle and unyielding conditions of the low-wage, primarily service work available in one rural county, “breaks”–either by quitting or losing a job–are not an uncommon occurrence. I argue that within the context of these low-wage service jobs, which offer employees little autonomy, quitting may be one of the only forms of resistance available to workers.","10.1300/j134v09n01_05","Journal of Poverty","Labour economics; Economics; Poverty; Turnover; Welfare reform; Safety net; Context (language use); Service (business); Service economy; Autonomy","en",4,"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v09n01_05?queryID=%24%7BresultBean.queryID%7D",1694,"Explored the work experiences of rural low-income women in the context of shifting labor markets.","Many resisted precarious jobs due to lack of childcare and employer mistreatment.","Design income poverty policies that ensure fair labor conditions and caregiving support in rural areas.","Income poverty",NA

Gill",2005,"Abstract A general argument is how states implement their TANF policy and the extent to which states build partnerships with local communities might affect the chances for low-income families to make a successful welfare-to-work transition. Using data gathered through a key-informant procedure, we find that many low-income families in Mississippi left the TANF rolls because the state implemented “front and back door” policy aimed at reducing caseloads rather than placing clients on a path to self-sufficiency. The results show that the state has failed to address the “true barriers” to work, such as a “mismatch” between training and available jobs, appropriate economic development and transportation and childcare needs. The results also indicate that shifting public responsibility to the clients and local communities will further compromise the well-being of many low-income families because, under TANF, they will pay the cost of their own disadvantage.","10.1300/j134v09n01_04","Journal of Poverty","Public economics; Welfare; Economics; Work (electrical); Poverty; Devolution; Welfare reform; Disadvantage; Compromise; Economic growth; Social Welfare","en",8,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v09n01_04",1742,"Tested the effectiveness of TANF's work-first approach in helping families achieve self-sufficiency.","While some found jobs, most remained in poverty due to low wages and lack of child care.","Revise social protection to link work requirements with living wages and caregiving supports.","Income poverty; Social protection",NA

"763","Sticking plaster support: the Household Support Fund and localised assistance in the UK welfare state","Jed Meers; Kit Colliver; John Hudson; Neil Lunt",2024,"<jats:p>The Household Support Fund is a creature of crises. Initially conceived as a temporary palliative for struggling UK households in 2021 amid the devastating COVID-19 crisis, the local authority administered support is now in its fourth wave. Accounting for over £2.5 billion of funding since its introduction, it is a flagship component of the UK government’s response to the cost-of-living crisis. Drawing on interviews with 12 local authorities, we argue this scheme is part of an ongoing shift towards dependence on localised discretionary funds to mitigate increasingly insufficient central social security support – although the fund provides essential support for struggling households, this is not a role it can fulfil in its current form. The article falls into three parts. The first provides an overview of the origins of this cash-limited HSF scheme and situates it in the shifting role of localised support in the UK social security system. The second provides an overview of the method. The third draws four key themes from the interview data: a lack of funding leading to sticking plaster provision, problematic tensions between supporting those most at need and concerns about dependency on crisis funds, administrative capacity shaping scheme design, and third sector organisations’ increasing role in both mediating and providing support. We conclude that the HSF signifies a significant ongoing shift towards patchwork, localised support in the UK welfare state, subject to unpredictable renewal. Rather than comprehensive centralised provision, funds like the HSF are increasingly being tasked with mitigating insufficient working-age social security.</jats:p>","10.1332/17598273y2023d000000008","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Welfare; Government (linguistics); Social security; Business; Welfare state; State (computer science); Economic growth; Economics; Public administration; Political science; Politics; Market economy; Law; Linguistics; Philosophy; Algorithm; Computer science","en",3,"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/downloadpdf/journals/jpsj/aop/article-10.1332-17598273Y2023D000000008/article-10.1332-17598273Y2023D000000008.pdf",1753,"Evaluated the UK's Household Support Fund as a temporary crisis measure for low-income households.","The fund provided short-term relief but failed to address structural poverty or long-term needs.","Replace emergency-only schemes with sustained social protection that tackles root causes of poverty.","Social protection",NA

Methodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection.

Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.&#x0D;
Findings: The study revealed a complex relationship characterized by mixed outcomes. While some agricultural investments contribute positively to food security by enhancing productivity, improving infrastructure, and generating income opportunities, others can lead to land grabbing, displacement of local communities, and resource degradation, exacerbating food insecurity. The effectiveness of investments in enhancing food security hinges on factors such as the type of investment, local contexts, and policy frameworks, emphasizing the need for carefully designed and context-specific investment strategies to ensure sustainable and equitable food security outcomes.&#x0D;

This article provides new empirical evidence regarding how the precariat encounter and experience the reformed welfare delivery system. It seeks to explore theoretically whether the precariat is being 'activated' and/or 'civilised'. The author finds that the primary role of Jobcentre Plus is to assess whether the unemployed are 'active'. This has been interpreted by Marxist scholars as a class disciplinary project which renders labour more dependent upon precarious work. However, the evidence presented here suggests that an inappropriate white-collar model of support combined with sanctions frequently results in ill-discipline and disentitlement from benefits. Furthermore, support cannot be conceptualised as a 'civilising offensive' because it is not a deliberate and targeted attempt at inculcating 'civilised' behaviour. Moreover, rather than enforcing the norms of civilised behaviour it drives many into destitution and crime.","10.1332/175982719x15622552304853","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Marxist philosophy; Political economy; Empirical evidence; Offensive; Political science; Precarious work; State (polity); Sanctions; Precariat; Public employment service","en",6,"https://shura.shu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24717",1793,"Analyzed reforms in the UK’s public employment services under a work-first activation model.","Emphasis on rapid employment overlooked skill development and long-term job quality.","Revise activation strategies in social protection to prioritize sustainable, quality employment.","Social protection",NA

"796","Nostalgia narratives? Pejorative attitudes to welfare in historical perspective : survey evidence from Beveridge to the British Social Attitudes Survey","John Hudson; Neil Lunt; Charlotte Marie Hamilton; Sophie Mackinder; Chelsea Swift; Jed Meers",2016,"Jensen and Tyler (2015) have powerfully argued that 'anti-welfare commonsense', fuelled by negative political and media discourse stressing welfare dependency and deception, has buttressed support for social security reform in recent years. Along with many other academics they point to the hardening of public attitudes towards welfare state provision and how notions of the 'deserving' and 'undeserving poor' have been reintroduced into popular debates. We identify four distinct threads within this scholarship. First, there is an argument that public attitudes have shifted from an earlier post-war welfare imaginary and settlement to an anti-welfare consensus. Second, this hardening includes a growing prevalence of 'othering'. The third thread is the broadening of this moral and disciplinary gaze to include groups, such as disabled people, who until recently were not subject to the same amount of stigma as other types of benefit recipients. Fourth, is the impact of pejorative welfare discourses on the self-identity and attitudes of disadvantaged groups. While a growing body of evidence makes it increasingly difficult to argue against suggestions that there is a hostile body of anti-welfare sentiment in the UK, what is often implicit in the analysis of pejorative contemporary attitudes to welfare is the view that there was once a 'golden age' of the welfare state when public support was more fully behind a strong set of social security benefits provided as a social right of citizenship. Whether this was the case is a moot point however. Few studies have tried to piece together the attitudes to welfare of the general public during the consensus era. We attempt to undertake such a task here, drawing on ad hoc attitudes surveys and polling data in particular. Specifically, we focus on how notions of the 'deserving' and 'undeserving poor' play out in this data, pointing to some key continuities found in contemporary and historical public attitudes to welfare.","10.1332/175982716x14721954315002","Journal of Poverty and Social Justice","Welfare; Gender studies; Welfare state; The Imaginary; Sociology; British Social Attitudes Survey; Pejorative; Scholarship; Welfare dependency; Social psychology; Politics","en",12,"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.1332/175982716X14721954315002",1843,"Explored pejorative public attitudes toward welfare recipients in Britain through discourse analysis.","Welfare nostalgia often masked deep-seated class bias and resistance to redistributive policy.","Reframe social protection narratives to counter classism and legitimize poverty reduction efforts.","Social protection",NA

As more women moved into the paid labor force, these previously separate groups have melded into a single group–working mothers. In this research, we analyze the likelihood of former welfare recipients being eligible for UI using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Our analysis compares UI eligibility in the early 1990s (before welfare reform), with the late 1990s (after welfare reform). In general, we find that despite a strong labor market in the late 1990s relative to the early 1990s, former welfare recipients were less likely to meet the earnings requirements for UI eligibility, owing largely to an increase in the share of welfare leavers with little or no earnings.","10.1300/j134v10n03_01","Journal of Poverty","Welfare; Labour economics; Economics; Survey of Income and Program Participation; Social Right; Welfare reform; Unemployment; Earnings","en",6,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v10n03_01",1851,"Reviewed unemployment insurance access pre- and post-reform for part-time and gig workers in the U.S.","Many nontraditional workers were excluded, leaving them without income during job loss.","Modernize employment and social protection systems to include all types of workers.","Employment; Social protection",NA

The stated goal of the program was to break the intergenerational cycles of poverty. This end was to be achieved by investing in the basic capacities of the poor, particularly poor women and their children. Basic capacities were to be developed through cash transfers for improved nutrition, scholarships for children, and preventative health measures. The key concern of this paper, however, is to examine how cash transfers for human capital development are more than instruments of poverty reduction. Rather, cash transfers are also techniques that effect a new way of governing individual conduct. The intended effect of Progresa was a change in the subjectivity of poor women from the passive recipients of aid to empowered market subjects who were now given the freedom to make choices, albeit limited choices.

A Critical Literature Review","Hannah Kimani Kimani",2022,"<jats:p>Purpose: Financial institutions improves the well-being of participants through job creation, increasing income and building assets (wealth). It makes poor people to be homeowners through schemes such as housing microfinance. The overall objective of this study was to examine influence of access to finances and poverty reduction in developing countries. A critical literature review&#x0D;
Methodology: The paper used a desk study review methodology where relevant empirical literature was reviewed to identify main themes and to extract knowledge gaps.&#x0D;
Findings: This study concluded that access to home improvement finances led to improvement in living conditions from living in shanties to permanent dwellings hence better living conditions and reduction in poverty. Access to school fees loans led to higher enrolment rates in schools improving literacy levels in developing countries and hence reducing poverty. Lower interest rates led to more access to microfinance loans and in the long run a reduction in poverty, availability of collaterals meant ability to pay and credit worthiness of respondent’s hence easier access to microfinance loans which leads to poverty reduction in the long run. Favourable credit policy led to increased access to microfinance loans and vice versa.&#x0D;
Unique Contribution to Theory, Policy and Practice: This study recommended that financial institutions that are able to give out loans to help serve the poor, should arrange mechanisms to improve technical and business skills of the poorest through training and loan utilization. This will enhance their business skills to use credit and establish market channels for their products.</jats:p>","10.47941/ijpid.1136","International Journal of Poverty, Investment and Development","Microfinance; Poverty; Loan; Respondent; Business; Developing country; Poverty reduction; Economics; Economic growth; Public economics; Finance; Political science; Law","en",0,"https://carijournals.org/journals/index.php/IJPID/article/download/1136/1354",1867,"Investigated how access to finance affects poverty reduction among women entrepreneurs in developing countries.","Microloans increased income, but barriers like loan size and repayment rules limited long-term impact.","Refine financial inclusion strategies under intersectional poverty policy to enhance support for women-led businesses.","Financial inclusion; Intersectional poverty","Influence; Access; Finances; Poverty Reduction; Developing Countries"

A review of the monetary poverty indicator in the EU","Mónica Martí; Carmen Ródenas",2024,"<jats:p>This article seeks to contribute to the generation of more accurate poverty indicators in the EU, by providing some further evidence of potential bias when joint income-wealth perspective on poverty measurement is not considered. Using the 2018 EU-SILC, we compare the individuals’ financial satisfaction and his/her household classification as at risk of poverty (AROP). We detect a significant group of people whose households are classified as poor but who are satisfied with their economic situation. The explanations for this mismatch lie both in errors in the income estimation and in the presence of household wealth. Through an exploratory analysis with certain limitations, we find that those in this group have different characteristics from the rest of the poor and are more similar to those who are neither poor nor dissatisfied when we analyse economic stress and <jats:italic>proxy</jats:italic> wealth variables.

However, for many low-income families, child care expenses are so high that they often cannot afford it without government support. Also problematic is that government-supported child care benefits are incrementally lost as a family’s income increases, but often before sufficient income can be sustained to replace that support. This is known as the child care cliff. The focus of this study was to understand how families make decisions about child care and government support when facing this cliff. This article details a mixed-methods study that revealed that families use a combination of resources to make up their income package that they need to manage everyday survival, including government benefits, wages, and social supports.

"826","Efficiency of Local Resource Mobilization in the Implementation of Socio-Economic Programmes by Local Churches in Kibra, Nairobi, Kenya","Njagi Nancy; Wanjiku Irungu; Charity Koome; Peter St",2022,"Poverty is a human phenomenal that society continually ponders about and has been in existence since time in memorial. Governments and international organizations have developed strategies towards poverty reduction. Churches through their social welfare departments have not been left behind in seeking appropriate ways of addressing the socio-economic struggles that members within their community face. This journal article focuses on one of the largest impoverished slums in Nairobi, Kenya; Kibra slum. The reported census population of Kibra has always been contentious but the stories of the residents and the living conditions within the settlement clearly depict the struggles experienced. Kibra is home to unemployed and underemployed residents who struggle to put food on their tables every day. Majority of whom are tenants with months of rent arrears because paying rent is not a priority. They live in one-roomed houses with little organization for sewage and toilet facilities. A single toilet and bathroom are shared by several families at a fee that is not inclusive of their rent. In response to these and other challenges such as education and health care, local churches in the slum have set up socio-action programmes. This article stems from my research work among Kibra residents, and documents the findings that respond to the effectiveness of local church programmes to utilize local resource mobilization in poverty reduction among residents. The researcher uses a mixed methods research approach. Drawing from the research findings, socio-economic programmes run by the church have a high dependency on external finding and are not taking advantage of the human capital within the slum community. Residents also exhibit high levels of dependency on the church or the pastor running the programme. There are however programmes that are set up by the residents such as savings groups or a youth centre encountered in the research that do not rely on any external support. The youth and members of the savings groups contribute their resources to run their programmes. Their local resource mobilization efforts enhance their participation and ability to make decisions and take responsibility of these decisions. Dependency on external support and hand-outs have crippled residents of Kibra slum however on the other hand, it is possible for residents to identify a project that meets their needs and run it successfully with their own resources.

Methodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.
Findings: Microfinance in Bangladesh has boosted incomes, improved housing and food security, and empowered women economically, fostering entrepreneurship and decision-making. It has also enhanced social cohesion and community development through economic participation. Despite challenges, microfinance remains crucial for poverty reduction in Bangladesh.
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Social capital theory, agency theory &amp; capability approach may be used to anchor future studies on analyze the impact of microfinance initiatives on poverty alleviation in Bangladesh.

Porterfield; Hyeji Choi-Ko; Hong-Sik Yoon",2003,"ABSTRACT This paper documents the impact of the 1996 federal welfare legislation on rural families in Missouri. We analyze primary data obtained from interviews with 162 single-mother families with children residing in six rural counties in Missouri who are either former or current welfare recipients. This information was substantiated by focus group interviews with current or former welfare recipients conducted between 1998 and 2000. The results provide useful insights into the impacts of welfare reform on families in rural America. Welfare recipients in rural areas have higher levels of education and job experience than the general welfare population in the nation, but they live in areas with fewer job opportunities and very poor public transportation. Those who are employed are making an average of $5.50 per hour and continue to live in poverty. With the economy slowing down across the nation, rural welfare recipients are beginning to increase again, after several years of decline.

Nonprofit Directors' and Poor Women's Assessments of FBOs","Rebecca Joyce Kissane",2008,"ABSTRACT Over the last decade, policy-makers have pushed faith-based organizations (FBOs) to increase their role in providing services to welfare-reliant and low-income families. Using data from qualitative research, I detail how poor women and nonprofit directors serving poor individuals in Philadelphia have conflicting understandings of FBOs. A substantial proportion of secular nonprofit directors question whether FBOs have the capacity to provide the range of services poor women need. Furthermore, nonprofit directors largely focused on how FBOs differ from other types of social service providers in four main areas: (1) individualized, caring treatment of clients, (2) religiosity in service delivery, (3) connections to the community, and (4) professionalization. Interviews with the poor women, however, counter many of the nonprofit directors' assumptions and reveal that these women experience FBOs and secular nonprofits in similar ways.

Various ideological perspectives suggest different policies to address poverty: orthodox economic theory emphasizes human capital enhancement such as training and education; an institutionalist approach emphasizes reducing labor market barriers to equality and provision of decent, stable public service employment; the radical or Marxist lens posits that labor, including those transitioning from welfare, needs to organize for economic and political power. Recent welfare reform embodies a fourth, neoliberal perspective that stresses ‘labor force attachment’ strategies.

I identify and map the three sets of welfare neighborhoods in the two most populous urban jurisdictions in the United States, New York City and Los Angeles County.

As Indonesia rapidly evolves as an emerging economy, the paper highlights the critical role Jakarta plays in shaping the future trajectory of its vast human resources. It underpins the urgency for comprehensive policies that prioritize improved education, social welfare, and economic opportunities, particularly for the underprivileged youth. The paper argues that inclusive policies, even within predominantly elite-focused resource allocations, are paramount for fostering equity in the labor market. With a focus on the pervasive issue of prostitution, the paper elucidates how socioeconomic factors contribute to the phenomenon and evaluates existing anti-prostitution policies. By uncovering gaps in the current approach, the article advocates for pro-poor and pro-development strategies to mitigate crime. Recognizing Indonesia's potential for urbanization and economic growth, the paper contends that disciplined citizenship, achievable through incentivizing conventional paths for the younger and underprivileged population, is crucial for the nation's prosperity. The proposed policy recommendations aim to guide local policymakers in formulating effective measures that not only address crime but also contribute to the overall development of Indonesia.","10.1080/10875549.2024.2379766","Journal of Poverty","Poverty; Prosperity; Economic growth; Development economics; Population; Sociology; Urbanization; Political science; Economics; Demography","en",1,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10875549.2024.2379766?needAccess=true",1991,"Synthesized sociological perspectives on poverty and the implications for policy reform.","Policy often misrepresents structural drivers of poverty, focusing instead on individual blame.","Realign social protection frameworks to address systemic causes of poverty.","Social protection",NA

In doing so, separate lines of research argued that welfare-spending inclinations can be swayed by a person's class, race and gender statuses. Moreover, different studies connected welfare appraisals to a person's explanation of poverty, racial inequalities and gender hierarchies. As these inquiries provide critical insights these insights were hampered by a lack of theoretical breadth since they coalesced around a small set of independent variables. In effect, while theoreticians have linked class, race and gender matters, published quantitative works have routinely focused on only one set of class, race, or gender variables (i.e., numerous researchers consider welfare preferences in light of class and race interpretations as they neglect gender matters, or vice versa).

This may increase the removal rate of Indian children due to perceived child neglect. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Adoptions and Safe Families Act of 1997 present challenges to ICWA by ignoring both the rationale and protections of ICWA. In contrast, the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 explicitly exempts Indian children in recognition of ICWA goals and rationale.

The article considers the revised eligibility criteria for welfare benefits and two policies which can provide accommodation: the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allows applicants to join family members in the UK, and the Ukrainian Sponsorship Scheme (known as ‘Homes for Ukraine’) which allows Ukrainian nationals to come to the UK if they have a sponsor who can provide accommodation for at least six months.

The Job Corps, a core anti-poverty program, trained young men and women in basic skills and prepared them for jobs in the skilled trades. While job training for young, African-American women emphasized middle-class, homemaking skills, young men received training in the skilled trades.

Studies evaluating the impact of housing subsidies on child and adolescent mental health, however, are generally inconclusive. This may reflect variation in the influence by type of subsidies to income, improved physical environment, increased access to resources, and improved perception of neighborhood safety. Further, most prior research focused on housing subsidies failed to simultaneously formally assess child psychopathology. In the present study, we examine, among adolescents (ages 9-17) from a low-income, urban minority area, the association of housing with psychiatric symptoms and disorders, as well as with their social functioning. The data were obtained from the Stress & Justice Study (S&J) baseline survey, an investigation designed to examine impact of parental criminal justice system involvement (CJSI) on their children's mental health. Housing type during the past year was categorized from parental report as public housing, section 8, both, or neither. Child mental health was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). Additionally, family resources and physical quality of the housing environment by housing type was assessed, and we tested whether these dimensions mediated associations of housing type with the adolescent's current mental health outcomes. We found that while internalizing and externalizing disorders and impairment were attenuated by individual characteristics (e.g., SES, CJSI), internalizing and externalizing symptom counts were significantly more prevalent among children in subsidized housing, compared to those in non-subsidized housing, after controlling for individual characteristics. These findings have the potential to inform whether, and through which mechanisms, housing subsidies are associated with adolescent mental health.","10.1007/s12552-021-09322-7","Race and social problems","Welfare; Voucher; Mental health; Child psychopathology; Psychology; Social work; Subsidized housing; Public housing; Subsidy; Environmental health","en",0,"https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34149954",2053,"Reviewed the Home Visiting Program’s mental health outcomes for high-risk youth in urban areas.","Participants reported improved mental health, school engagement, and reduced risky behavior.","Scale home visiting programs to strengthen social protection for vulnerable urban youth.","Social protection","Child Psychopathology; Housing Subsidies; Housing Vouchers; Mental Health; Public Housing; Section 8"

Morton had concluded that Caucasians had larger brains, and therefore higher intellectual capacity, based on the measurement of the cranial capacities of skulls that Gould considered to be biased. Heated debates about the meaning of race, specifically whether it is a biological reality or socially constructed, continue to this day (Bamshad et al. 2004; Braun and Hammonds 2008; Gravelee 2009) . Needless to say, whether race is biological has major implications for how it is used to understand the nature and extent of the group differences in health seen in the United States. Further, although we have made some progress in our understanding of how race, social factors, and biology might interact to affect health in the United States, our understanding remains imperfect. There is general agreement that the causes of group differences in health, variously referred to as health disparities, health inequities, and health inequalities, are multifactorial, with contributions from the societal to the cellular levels that interact in ways not yet fully understood (Gehlert and Colditz 2011).

Second, it is important to understand how traditional patterns of racial inequality among were transformed during the years of the recession. Finally, it is not clear whether recession-related changes in socioeconomic inequalities continued to have implications for child well-being in the post-recession period. Results from this analysis indicate that the adverse effects of the recession were most intense in states with significant changes in their populations of Black and Latino immigrant children. The results further show that declines in parental work opportunities were more consequential for poverty among Whites and Asians.

In doing so, I summarize the evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings demonstrate that, compared to white children, black and Latino children are more likely to have experienced poverty and food insufficiency, to have had parents lose their jobs, and to be exposed to distance learning and school closures during the pandemic. I argue that though COVID-19 has indeed worsened racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being, it has also served to place a spotlight on the American welfare state's historical mistreatment of low-income families and black and Latino families in particular. Consider that around three-fourths of black and Latino children facing food insufficiency during the pandemic also experienced food insufficiency prior to the onset of the pandemic. Moving forward, analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in child well-being during the pandemic, I argue, must not only consider the economic shock and high unemployment rates of 2020, but the failure of the American welfare state to adequately support jobless parents, and black and Latino parents in particular, long before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived.","10.1007/s12552-021-09319-2","Race and social problems","Welfare; Welfare state; Ethnic group; Sociology; Social work; Poverty; Demographic economics; Shock (economics); Race (biology); Pandemic","en",17,"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12552-021-09319-2.pdf",2061,"Analyzed how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed racial disparities in the U.S. welfare state.","Black and Latinx communities faced greater economic precarity due to longstanding inequities in benefit access.","Revise social protection policies to reduce racial disparities in eligibility and coverage during crises.","Social protection","COVID-19; Child well-being; Families; Poverty; Race"

It was found that work was viewed as the legitimate source of sustenance; their commitment to it was as strong as that of employed white-and blue-collar workers who had been investigated in other studies using the same methodological technique. While the economic function of work appeared to be paramount among them, there was a marked tendency to prize work for the social function that it provided by conferring respectability on the employed individual.

"864","Revolution in the Garbage Dump: The Political and Economic Foundations of the Colombian Recycler Movement, 1986-2011","Manuel Rosaldo",2016,"Flouting 150 years of reports on their political impotence, millions of informal workers have recently begun mobilizing for labor rights. What provoked this unexpected development? This article analyzes the Colombian informal recycler movement—a “least likely” case for successful mobilization due to the recyclers’ extreme marginality and the Colombian state’s violent repression of labor movements. The article argues that the rise of neoliberalism and the consolidation of democracy created political opportunities that conventional perspectives on the informal economy would not lead us to expect. Three specific links connected these macro-level transformations to increases in the recyclers’ collective organizing capacity.

"865","Promoting civil rights through the welfare state: how Medicare integrated Southern hospitals.","Jill Quadagno",2000,"Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed segregation and banned racial discrimination in employment and education, compliance was uneven across institutional spheres. Racial integration proceeded more rapidly and smoothly in the health care system than in other institutions because the new Medicare program, the largest expansion of the welfare state since the New Deal, provided the leverage to force health care providers to comply with the law. In this paper, I extend the axiom that the welfare state is a mechanism of social stratification to theorize processes of racial stratification. Drawing upon power resource and feminist theories of the welfare state, I argue that the welfare state can promote racial equality if 1) political resources are available to challenge racially-discriminatory practices; 2) institutions that reproduce systems of oppression are incorporated into the public sphere; 3) the rules and conditions for the distribution of benefits support the objective of racial equality; and 4) the benefits are provided on a continuous and universal basis.","10.1525/sp.2000.47.1.03x0280t","Social problems","Welfare state; Racism; Economics; Human rights; Legislation; Public sphere; Racial integration; Public administration; Social stratification; Politics; Welfare; State (computer science); Civil rights; Political science; Law; Computer science; Algorithm","en",43,"https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18050538",2068,"Reviewed how welfare programs have advanced civil rights and equity for marginalized groups.","Social policies can serve as tools for inclusion but often fall short due to poor design or bias.","Reform intersectional poverty policies to promote equity and expand access to social protection.","Employment; Intersectional poverty; Social protection",NA

Most important, our results show that the relative racial parity in wages that once existed in public sector employment has eroded in the face of new governance, and racial inequalities for both men and women have intensified. Supplementary and decomposition analyses further highlight the potential escalation of discrimination as a core mechanism under new governance.

Although food insecurity disproportionately affects lower-income households, it remains unclear why some lower-income families are more vulnerable to food insecurity than others. Household unsecured debt, such as debt incurred from credit cards and medical bills, may be an unexplored financial constraint associated with food insecurity. Using data from the 2014 Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I assess whether unsecured debt, by amount and type of debt, is associated with food insecurity among lower-income households with children (N=1,319). Results indicate that medical debt increases odds of household food insecurity even after accounting for key sociodemographic and economic risk factors, while no relationship exists between other forms of unsecured debt and food insecurity. Moreover, although liquid assets decrease the risk of household food insecurity and attenuate the harmful effects associated with unpaid medical bills, few households have enough liquid assets to mitigate the risks associated with medical debt.

This ethnographic study of a parenting class serving low-income African American mothers examines tensions between parents and instructors over the use of physical force in disciplining children or in resolving conflicts more broadly. The article uses the concept of cultural frames to analyze how parents and instructors understood the issues at stake, showing significant differences between the frame the instructors used (discouraging all forms of force) and that of the parents (who saw force as sometimes necessary and effective). The instructors' therapeutic frame positioned children as vulnerable and prioritized self-esteem and positive relationships, and it did not resonate with parents, whose protective frame emphasized their responsibility to keep children safe in a dangerous world. This study examines interactions between parents and instructors to show that when frames come into conflict in social settings, collective affirmation of a particular frame can be a source of resistance and solidarity, thus raising questions about the potential of anti-poverty interventions that do not pay attention to context or meaning making.</jats:p>","10.1093/socpro/spaa045","Social Problems","Sociology; Class (computer programming); Meaning-making; Social psychology","en",2,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/68/4/1010/5953173",2082,"Observed peer conflict and discipline practices among children in low-income schools.","Violence was normalized in some contexts, linked to institutional neglect and poverty stress.","Fund trauma-informed education programs under income poverty policy to disrupt cycles of violence.","Income poverty",NA

Formerly-incarcerated men must repeatedly engage with parole, public assistance agencies, transitional housing facilities, and community-based service providers to maintain freedom and access food, shelter, and rehabilitative services. Accessing resources requires the men simultaneously to manage multiple, overlapping entanglements across a fragmented network of bureaucracies. This runaround exacerbates the stress of poverty, breeds distrust of state authorities, and, in some cases, precipitates recidivism. Former prisoners learned how to cope with the runaround by treating systems navigation as a full-time occupation, but these skills did not translate into long-term economic security. Most study participants recurrently cycled between low-wage jobs, transitional housing facilities, and public assistance programs for years after release. This article illustrates the need to theorize prisoner reentry as a process that unfolds across a network of criminal justice and welfare bureaucracies and demonstrates how formerly-incarcerated men experience citizenship not only through coercive encounters with the criminal justice system but also through their simultaneous entanglements with safety-net bureaucracies.</jats:p>","10.1093/socpro/spz018","Social Problems","Welfare; Sociology; Poverty; Punishment; Prison; Criminology","en",44,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/67/2/233/5524584",2084,"Investigated how welfare and criminal justice systems jointly punish people living in poverty.","Clients experienced bureaucratic hurdles, sanctions, and surveillance across institutions.","Redesign social protection systems to reduce punitive overlaps with criminal justice.","Social protection",NA

Changes in Latino poverty rates and income inequality are examined for the 58 metropolitan areas with populations of 25,000 or more Latinos in 1980. Multivariate analysis reveals that residence in the more segregated metropolitan areas was a significant predictor of Latino poverty but was not significant in predicting Latino/Anglo income inequality. Changes in local labor market conditions had little effect on Latino poverty and income inequality, but changing Latino labor force characteristics—particularly increasing educational attainment, declining male labor force participation, and rising female labor force participation—were associated with decreases in poverty and reductions in income inequality.

"883","The Unequal Weight of Discrimination: Gender, Body Size, and Income Inequality","Katherine Mason",2012,"At present, most work examining the well-documented relationship between social inequality and body size treats fatness as an effect, caused either by some factor that determines weight and social class simultaneously, or by social class itself. However, the relationship between weight and social inequality is more complex than these explanations suggest. Recent studies by John Cawley (2004) and Charles Baum and William Ford (2004) suggest that fatness is often a contributor to inequality, not merely an effect.

This article examines the causes of income inequalities between obese and nonobese workers, focusing on how gender interacts with body size to determine the size and duration of those inequalities. Drawing on data from the 1997–2008 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), I introduce a positive test for discrimination, which provides a methodological advantage over previous research in this area. I then pose two questions: first, is anti-obesity discrimination to blame for income inequalities between obese and nonobese workers? Second, do women and men's experiences of those inequalities differ? The results indicate that very obese men do face one form of discrimination–statistical discrimination–but that they can overcome initial disadvantages with time. In contrast, obese women's income disadvantages persist over time, suggesting the presence of prejudicial discrimination. In combination with previous studies illustrating how fat women are disadvantaged in educational attainment and marriage outcomes–two important means of accessing economic resources–this research shows one mechanism by which weight, particularly in combination with gender, is a major vector of U.S. inequality.","10.1525/sp.2012.59.3.411","Social Problems","Social class; Psychology; Social inequality; National Longitudinal Surveys; Educational attainment; Disadvantaged; Blame; Inequality; Economic inequality; Social psychology","en",48,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2012.59.3.411",2102,"Assessed how gender and race-based discrimination impact health among low-income populations.","Discrimination significantly worsened self-rated health outcomes, particularly among women of color.","Target anti-discrimination efforts within income poverty policy to reduce health disparities.","Income poverty; Intersectional poverty",NA

In an attempt to gain a fuller understanding of political participation among the urban poor, we investigated variations in economic hardship, political attitudes, and interactions with government agents of a sample of 462 low-income men and women in one of the poorest congressional districts in the country. By working from a theoretical perspective that allowed us to understand better how urban poverty affects the willingness to participate in the political system, we uncovered important nuances and differences in factors that affected political behavior among citizens living in poverty. Our data revealed two central findings: First, material resources and the demographic attributes usually associated with a propensity to participate politically drove political activism even among urban poor respondents. Second, and more importantly, severe economic hardship, as well as formative contact with government agents whom citizens living in urban poverty routinely face, served as significant experiences that bolstered the willingness to participate in the political system. Ultimately, we conclude that the decision to participate in the political system cannot be divorced from the very specific manner in which citizens encounter government.","10.1525/sp.2001.48.3.362","Social Problems","Welfare; Sociology; Government; Voting behavior; Poverty; Social policy; Political system; Economic growth; Political communication; Politics","en",113,"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/poli_fac/216/",2104,"Analyzed the political participation patterns of low-income urban residents.","Despite barriers, many poor individuals engage politically through nontraditional channels.","Support civic engagement initiatives in social protection policies to amplify low-income voices.","Social protection",NA

Inductive analysis reveals five primary motivations for non-marriage among low-income single mothers. Most mothers agree that potential marriage partners must earn significantly more than the minimum wage, but also emphasize the importance of stability of employment, source of earnings, and the effort men expend to find and keep their jobs. Mothers place equal or greater emphasis on non-monetary factors such as how marriage may diminish or enhance respectability, how it may limit their control over household decisions, their mistrust of men, and their fear of domestic violence. Affordability, respectability, and control have greater salience for African American mothers, while trust and domestic violence have greater salience for whites. The author discusses these findings in relation to existing theories of marriage and in light of welfare reform.","10.1525/sp.2000.47.1.03x0282v","Social Problems","Sociology; Salience (language); Marriage promotion; Welfare reform; Minimum wage; Earnings; Poison control; Single mothers; Domestic violence; Social psychology","en",295,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/47/1/112/1619375",2107,"Interviewed low-income single mothers on their views about marriage and economic stability.","Most viewed marriage as desirable but financially impractical due to insecure economic conditions.","Revise income poverty programs to address structural barriers to family stability.","Income poverty",NA

               <jats:p>We examine two mechanisms–social capital and socio-behavior–potentially linking unemployment rates to opioid-related mortality and investigate whether the mechanisms differ geographically by the pace of the opioid crisis. Applying path analysis techniques to 2015–2017 opioid-related mortality in U.S. counties (N=2,648), we find that (1) high unemployment rates are not directly associated with opioid-related mortality rates; (2) high unemployment rates are negatively associated with social capital, and low social capital contributes to high opioid-related mortality; (3) high unemployment rates increase social isolation and the prevalence of smoking, which is positively related to opioid-related mortality; and (4) the pathways are stronger among counties in the states experiencing a rapid growth in opioid-related mortality rates than among those states that are not.

The range is from preferential treatment to discrimination-in-reverse. In the former the emphasis is on equity restoration; in the latter on indemnification. Preferential treatment and discrimination-in-reverse vary in their effect on potential beneficiaries, their technical qualifications, and their self-perception. Socially sanctioned favoritism is a relatively new approach in the area of race relations. The subject is inherently sensitive.

Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profle events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I fnd that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so.

The study shows that while the policy implemented is marked by strong exclusionary practices, some state agencies endorse and implement inclusionary approaches that contradict the basic assumptions of the migration regime. This inconsistency is analyzed considering the distinct institutional interests of different state agencies. This conceptualization of the state as a heterogeneous institutional complex sheds light on the complexities of the politics of exclusion and inclusion. It is concluded that, even in cases in which the migration regime is strongly associated with restrictive ethno-national conceptions of membership, certain state agencies develop institutional interests that lead to inclusionary approaches. These approaches, in turn, can create openings leading to the partial inclusion of migrant workers in the welfare state. At a more general level, the study contributes to the examination of policy innovations that depart from the principles of dominant institutional settings, arguing that new interests and agendas developed by state agencies play a crucial role in these processes.","10.1525/sp.2000.47.1.03x0279s","Social Problems","Welfare state; Sociology; State (polity); Context (language use); General level; Migrant workers; Development economics; Inclusion (disability rights); Conceptualization; Politics","en",60,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097151",2121,"Investigated how migration regimes intersect with intra-state conflicts and poverty in Africa.","Restrictive migration policies often intensified poverty and displacement in conflict zones.","Revise migration and social protection policies to reduce conflict-related poverty.","Migration and poverty; Social protection",NA

Vaughan",1968,"This paper examines a dimension of the housing conditions of the urban poor that has been largely ignored—namely, the nature of the relationship between landlords and tenants. By its very nature, a conflict of interest exists within this relationship. But various strategies initiated primarily by landlords minimize overt conflict. If the landlord is not immediately dependent on a given tenant, the relationship tends to be marked by impersonality and consequent disinterest in the housing situation. When owners are less independent of their tenants, personalization of the relationship occasions non-economic reliance of the tenant upon the landlord. In attempting to prevent or minimize conflict, the conditions that underlie conflict of interests are not relieved. Such efforts tend, rather, to contribute to the situation that we find problematic.","10.2307/800006","Social Problems","Economy; Business; Labour economics; Personalization; Conflict of interest; Dimension (data warehouse); Relation (history of concept); Landlord; Low income; Urban poor","en",19,"http://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/16/2/208/1683958",2123,"Observed dynamics between landlords and tenants in a low-income urban neighborhood.","Tenants experienced power imbalances, unstable housing, and limited legal protection.","Strengthen tenant protections in income poverty housing policies to ensure stability.","Income poverty",NA
"893","Armed Conflict, International Linkages, and Women's Parliamentary Representation in Developing Nations","Melanie M. Hughes",2009,"Politics is arguably the arena in which gender inequality remains most pronounced. Yet in recent decades, women in some countries and regions of the world have made significant gains in legislative presence at the national level. But for women living outside of the industrialized West, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. Through separate analyses of 36 high-income, 86 middle-income, and 63 low-income countries, I demonstrate that past models of women's political representation fail to explain variation across low-income samples. Using multiple methods, I also explore two sets of factors that may be more salient predictors of women's parliamentary representation in low-income nations: civil war and international linkages. Although historically women have been unable to consolidate gains made during wartime into post-conflict political representation, I find that certain types of civil conflict during the 1980s and 1990s positively affect women's representation in low-income nations. Longer, larger-scale wars that contest the political system or serve to alter the composition of the government have the best prospects for creating opportunities for women to gain parliamentary seats. Brief case studies of women, war, and social change in Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tajikistan suggest that structural and cultural mechanisms may work in conjunction with political openings to produce post-conflict gains in women's political presence. Both women's lack of political representation and the tragic effects of civil war remain enduring challenges faced by the developing world, but at the intersection of these two problems, there is hope for women seeking political access.","10.1525/sp.2009.56.1.174","Social Problems","Sociology; Women's history; Social change; Representation (politics); Civil Conflict; Political system; Poison control; Development economics; Legislature; Politics","en",139,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/56/1/174/1644440",2124,"Examined the effects of armed conflict and international aid on women’s welfare in fragile states.","International linkages sometimes undermined local efforts to improve women’s well-being.","Align gender and poverty policies with local needs in post-conflict recovery contexts.","Gender and poverty","gender and politics; women in national legislatures; developing countries; civil war; international nongovernmental organizations"

In particular, it explores the notion of ""critical junctures"" and their role in path dependent policies. The article seeks to understand why the role of occupational welfare in Israel is so formidable and to examine the implications of this. Its focus is upon the crucial role that the labor movement played in the formation of this system during a critical juncture in the evolution of the Israeli welfare state. During the 1950s, the Israeli labor movement brought about the establishment of an extensive system of occupational welfare and a social security system for the elderly based primarily upon low universal state benefits and generous voluntary occupational benefits. The legacy of these systems is still very prevalent in the contemporary welfare state and has marked implications both for spending on social spending and the welfare of the elderly.","10.1525/sp.2002.49.3.432","Social Problems","Welfare; Welfare state; Variety (cybernetics); Economics; Order (exchange); Power (social and political); State (polity); Social security; Theoretical models; Development economics","en",33,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/49/3/432/1646868/",2128,"Compared labor movement outcomes during key historical turning points in social policy.","Strong unions shaped inclusive welfare policies when mobilization aligned with political openings.","Support labor organizing as part of social protection reform to improve equity.","Social protection",NA

We critically examine the history of low-income energy assistance (the federal Low Income Weatherization and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs) — the largest such effort in the United States to date — and explore the sources of decline and eventual transformation of these initiatives into largely symbolic adjuncts to state social welfare systems. Persistent inequalities in the distribution of energy assistance benefits are explored, and we use a series of CHAID models to analyze access routes to residual program benefits. Implications of the energy assistance case for other large-scale environmental equity efforts are considered. Suggestions are also offered for a more ecologically oriented and community-based approach to energy equity — one grounded in the realities of stratified environmental relations, better integrated with other social and environmental policies, and more clearly oriented toward the sustainability of natural and social systems.","10.2307/3097042","Social Problems","Public economics; Welfare state; Economics; Social system; Poverty; Natural resource; Equity (economics); Social Welfare; Weatherization; Sustainability","en",39,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/42/4/468/1684794",2130,"Evaluated the effectiveness of low-income energy assistance programs in the U.S.","Programs often delivered symbolic rather than substantive relief due to inadequate funding.","Increase investment in energy assistance to address material hardship under income poverty policy.","Income poverty",NA

(2) Women are more likely to perform family roles which substitute for employment. (3) Women are less affected financially by unemployment. I use survey data on unemployed and reemployed men and women in Israel to assess hypotheses derived from these explanations. The results confirm that employment status has stronger effects on depressive affect, anxiety, and morale for men than for women.

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with 194 lower-income household heads, we show that debt management strategies are influenced by a desire to promote a financially responsible, self-sufficient social identity. Families are reluctant to ask for assistance when faced with economic hardship because it undermines this identity. Because the need to pay on debts is less acute than the need to pay for regular monthly expenses like rent or groceries, debts receive a lower priority in the monthly budget and families typically juggle their debts in private rather than turning to social networks for assistance. In some cases, however, debts take on special meanings and are handled differently. Respondents prioritize debts when they perceive payment as affirming a self-sufficient or upwardly mobile identity, but they reject and ignore debts they view as unfair or unjust. Because the private coping strategies families employ trap them in costly cycles of indebtedness and hinder future mobility prospects, debt management strategies are consequential for long-term financial well-being.","10.1525/sp.2013.11262","Social Problems","Public economics; Debt; Business; Payment; Sociology of culture; Narrative; Perspective (graphical); Identity (social science); Lower income; Social identity theory","en",74,"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6049&context=faculty_scholarship",2132,"Explored how low-income families juggle competing expenses to meet basic needs.","Families frequently shifted money across bills, worsening stress and debt cycles.","Implement comprehensive income support programs to reduce financial juggling and hardship.","Income poverty","UI.1 5251sp.2:0 13.11Z6l.

Although our society has made college more universal through vastly increased access to postsecondary education, college completion has stagnated, and the return on a college degree varies by field of study. Therefore, gaining admission to college – even a four-year college – is no longer a guaranteed ticket to social mobility. As colleges and universities attract and enroll more diverse populations of students, the barriers to student success once enrolled remain prominent concerns. To explore stratification processes regarding student success, choice of major, and completion, interviews were conducted with 41 low-income students at a large research university. These interviews illustrate the ways that students’ aspirations are lowered after entering college and how the cooling-out process functions within STEM majors. The primary catalyst facilitating the lowering of student aspirations and migration out of STEM majors was negative experiences in introductory math and science courses. Students responded to this catalyst by either lowering their aspirations or changing their behavior to improve performance in those courses. Students who were able to persist in STEM majors had a family member or mentor who helped them to frame the problem as a reflection of their behavior, not their innate ability, and to strategize behavioral changes. Institutional agents played both the role of support which helped some students maintain their aspirations and the role of steering students out of STEM illustrating the importance of the messages we send as advisors, student affairs professionals, or faculty. These findings demonstrate the ways in which the cooling-out process works in four-year institutions to perpetuate structures of opportunity within degree attainment and access to elite careers.","10.1108/s0196-115220160000022003","Research in Social Problems and Public Policy","Pedagogy; Elite; Student affairs; Postsecondary education; Family member; Low income; Social mobility; Medical education; Medicine; Innate intelligence","en",1,"https://works.bepress.com/heather-haeger/4/",2134,"Investigated how institutional practices shape educational aspirations of low-income students.","Advisors often steered disadvantaged students away from ambitious academic goals.","Revise counseling practices to support aspiration development in income poverty education policy.","Income poverty",NA

For the most part, those studies overlook nonprofit urban community initiatives. This chapter begins to address the gap by presenting preliminary findings from a study that examines the development of community food initiatives that sell green produce in London.

Design/methodology/approach – The first part of the chapter draws on content analysis of literature produced by 15 initiatives and presents a brief overview. The second part presents case study analysis of the organizational, physical, and social context of two of the initiatives.

Findings – The findings indicate that many urban green produce initiatives have an explicit emphasis on the demand side of the producer–consumer connection. Those that emphasize sustainably produced food and fair trade may have difficulty drawing low-income customers, even if located in areas with high levels of deprivation. Initiatives oriented toward basic food access rather than sustainability are expanding their scope to include more “local” food.

Originality/value – Although this study does not represent urban green produce initiatives throughout England or beyond, it provides some examples of how such initiatives can develop and the extent to which they claim social justice and environmental considerations in their efforts. This study is a step toward empirical examination of nonprofit urban green produce initiatives, and contributes to a broader, more inclusive conceptualization of alternative food networks.","10.1108/s0196-1152(2010)0000018006","Research in Social Problems and Public Policy","Engineering; Content analysis; Marketing; European studies; Originality; Scope (project management); Economic growth; Fair trade; Food security; Sustainability; Conceptualization","en",3,"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0196-1152(2010)0000018006/full/html",2145,"Explored the role of community food programs in enhancing food security and sustainability.","Community-based food initiatives improved access and promoted local food systems in underserved areas.","Expand funding for local food programs to strengthen food security in vulnerable communities.","Food insecurity",NA

Overall, the results are fairly compatible with prior efforts, lending greater confidence to earlier findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prior studies covering the 1990s overestimate the decline in between-country inequality, but underestimate the rise in within-country inequality. Consequently, total inequality did not begin to decline substantially until the post-2000 era. After presenting these estimates, I then examine factors associated with income mobility among the 15,100 subnational percentile groups in my data set. The results suggest that (a) the negative effect of inequality is larger than the positive effect of economic growth among the poorest 25 percent of the world's population, and (b) late industrialization has contributed to income convergence between countries, while economic globalization has primarily served to stretch income distributions within nations.","10.1525/sp.2011.58.4.565","Social Problems","Income inequality metrics; Economics; Social inequality; Population; Inequality; Development economics; Measures of national income and output; Economic inequality; Income distribution; Economic globalization","en",37,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/58/4/565/1661350",2148,"Analyzed global income inequality trends using new longitudinal datasets.","While some regions improved, global inequality remained high and driven by wealth concentration.","Implement redistributive income poverty strategies to address persistent global disparities.","Income poverty",NA

Research that tracks low-income populations across educational transitions contains threats to validity that can compromise evidence-based educational policy and practice. The Big Picture Longitudinal Study is a national, multiyear study that follows low-income urban youth who were accepted into college as high school seniors. Triangulating the results of multiple longitudinal data sources showed that reported college aspirations and enrollment intentions were inconsistently and differently reported by students and teachers in the final semester of high school. Relying on a particular data source and time can result in mistakenly equating college aspirations and enrollment behaviors, these findings suggest. In particular, secondary school educators’ inflated assumptions about their students’ college aspirations can obscure the need for supporting multiple pathways to college and work for low-income, first-generation high school seniors.","10.1108/s0196-115220160000022006","Research in Social Problems and Public Policy","Equating; Mathematics education; Work (electrical); Political science; Longitudinal study; Attendance; Data source; Longitudinal data; Compromise","en",0,"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/S0196-115220160000022006",2152,"Traced college pathways among low-income students, focusing on aspiration and institutional barriers.","Students aspired to college but encountered systemic obstacles that derailed their plans.","Redesign education access policies to reduce structural hurdles for low-income youth.","Income poverty",NA

               <jats:p>Gentrification is controversial mainly because of the potential displacement of existing low-income groups. Many gentrifiers therefore grapple with the moral implications of their role in this process. Based on three years of fieldwork and 46 interviews in a small city, this paper explains how gentrifiers construct the moral frames they use to identify and justify both themselves and gentrification as morally good, and how their moral ideas shape their behaviors. It argues that their own sense of community is the social source for their moral frame of opportunity, which they use to assign value to actors and actions based on whether they help realize the city’s potential to revitalize, reduce poverty, and prevent displacement. This framing leads them either to support actors and actions behind “conditional gentrification” (i.e., gentrification they control) or oppose those who are against it. This paper shows how groups base justifications for morally questionable behavior on community, with strong implications for exacerbating inequalities.</jats:p>","10.1093/socpro/spab047","Social Problems","Sociology; Framing (construction); Virtue; Gentrification; Environmental ethics","en",4,"http://academic.oup.com/socpro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/socpro/spab047/40409541/spab047.pdf",2161,"Investigated how moral narratives and immigration status shape attitudes toward opportunity and assistance.","Immigrants often internalized meritocratic ideals even in the face of structural inequality.","Frame poverty policy to acknowledge barriers and support opportunity across immigrant communities.","Income poverty; Migration and poverty",NA

In dialogue with the literature on the impact of economic development on gender inequality in Asia and Latin America, we find that fast-paced, foreign capital-led economic growth is associated with a larger gender-poverty gap in Central and Eastern Europe, while generous welfare policies, specifically higher levels of spending on pensions and family policies, are correlated with women’s lower relative destitution. These findings evaluate the impact of neoliberal style “economic development” on gender inequality in a geopolitically specific context and suggest that structural adjustment and global market integration may exacerbate women’s vulnerability even when they are well equipped with human capital and other resources to compete with men in the labor market.

Estos hallazgos muestran el impacto del ""desarrollo economico"" neoliberal en la desigualdad de genero en un contexto geopolitico especifico y sugieren que el ajuste estructural y la integracion del mercado mundial pueden incrementar la vulnerabilidad de las mujeres, incluso cuando estas cuentan con capital humano y otros recursos para competir con los hombres en el mercado de trabajo.","10.1093/socpro/spv007","Social Problems","Economy; Political science; Poverty; Gender equality; Welfare economics; Socialist mode of production","en",13,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/62/2/286/1620950/Economic-Development-and-Gender-Equality",2167,"Critically reviewed how economic development programs integrate gender equality aims.","Many programs paid lip service to gender equality without addressing root causes of exclusion.","Integrate meaningful gender equality goals into poverty-alleviation economic development policies.","Gender and poverty","economic development; poverty; gender; SILC JEL: J16; P36; I32; C21"

               <jats:p>Eviction filing rates have declined in many large cities in the United States. Existing scholarship on eviction, which focuses on discrete tenant-landlord relationships, has few explanations for this decline. I consider whether community organizing by nonprofit organizations shapes the social organization of communities and causes landlords to file fewer eviction filings. In cities where tenant and anti-poverty organizing has become common, community-oriented nonprofit organizations advocate for disadvantaged communities and help residents avoid poverty. Community organizing has rarely been studied as a predictor of housing security among low-income tenants, despite studies of how community organizing shapes the use of property in wealthy neighborhoods. I estimate the causal effect of community organizations on eviction filing rates between 2000 and 2016 using longitudinal data and a strategy to account for the endogeneity of nonprofits and eviction. Evidence from year-to-year models in 75 large cities spanning sixteen years estimate that an addition of ten community nonprofits in a city of 100,000 residents is associated with a ten percent reduction in eviction filing. This effect is comparable to the effect of community organizations on murder and is roughly a third of the association between eviction and concentrated disadvantage.</jats:p>","10.1093/socpro/spac061","Social Problems","Eviction; Disadvantaged; Landlord; Poverty; Endogeneity; Disadvantage; Scholarship; Business; Demographic economics; Economic growth; Political science; Sociology; Economics; Law; Econometrics","en",1,"https://osf.io/yj4en/download",2174,"Measured the effects of community organizing on landlord behavior and housing outcomes.","Organizing efforts led to improved maintenance, rent negotiations, and tenant protections.","Fund tenant organizing to combat housing insecurity and strengthen renter rights.","Housing insecurity",NA

Although previous explanations accurately point to the role of “open” state structures, agrarian politics, and the rise of the Social Democratic party in the making of the Swedish welfare system, none of these explanations grounds its analysis in the dynamics of capitalist state building in early twentieth-century Sweden. When this is done, the more useful explanation focuses on the role of a fragmented capitalist class building alliances with increasingly polarized agrarian interests in order to stave off economic and political threats from below. These class politics took shape within a state that had historically relied on concessions to ""the people"" to maintain its legitimacy.","10.2307/3097037","Social Problems","Welfare state; Agrarian society; Economics; State (polity); Capitalist state; Class analysis; Social Democratic Party; Market economy; Legitimacy; Politics","en",13,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097037",2176,"Traced the early political and institutional foundations of the Swedish welfare state.","Coalitions between labor and agrarian interests enabled expansive social protection policies.","Support broad coalitions in social protection reform to build durable anti-poverty institutions.","Social protection",NA

This research argues that these national problems are embedded within the context of increasingly complex multi-dimensional international networks, commonly referred to as globalization. Using cross-national comparisons among 88 less developed countries, I construct a series of structural equation models to estimate the effects of two aspects of globalization, foreign capital dependence and trade openness, on these three domestic concerns between 1980 and 1997. I find that foreign capital dependence has a positive effect on income inequality, raises fertility rates, accelerates population growth and retards economic development.

Additionally, this article questions the perception that educational institutions function primarily as agents of social reproduction, by showing that institutional agents such as high school teachers and administrators can function as “cultural guides” to bolster students’ opportunities for social mobility. Drawing on interviews with graduates of King and Chavez, two early college high schools which target low-income, first-generation college students, I find that King graduates were more strategic help-seekers and were more likely to use campus-based resources than their counterparts at Chavez, in part because their school’s curriculum explicitly and systematically taught this skill. This article challenges the perception that teachers and administrators function exclusively as gatekeepers in educational institutions. Instead, the data presented show that these institutional agents can also function as “cultural guides” who transmit cultural capital in the form of help-seeking values and behaviors to students from economically marginalized communities; promoting their upward mobility.</jats:p>","10.1093/socpro/spaa023","Social Problems","Sociology; Transition (fiction); Cultural capital; Help-seeking; First generation; Low income; Demographic economics","en",29,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/socpro/spaa023/33439238/spaa023.pdf",2178,"Studied how cultural capital influences help-seeking behavior among low-income individuals.","Cultural norms and distrust often deterred people from accessing available resources.","Tailor income poverty interventions to account for cultural barriers and build trust in services.","Income poverty",NA
"920","Expanding Homes and Increasing Inequalities: U.S. Housing Development and the Residential Segregation of the Affluent","Rachel E. Dwyer",2007,"Theories of metropolitan development in the United States explain that higher status populations tend to occupy newer housing while lower status groups tend to be restricted to older housing. The housing system thus reflects the broader stratification structure and likely changes in response to important shifts like the steep rise of income inequality at the end of the twentieth century. Indeed, a striking trend of increasingly large houses with many amenities emerged in U.S. metropolitan areas during this period, indicating that new construction may have become ever more exclusive and targeted to the affluent as inequality rose. In this article, I investigate whether the stratifying impact of new house construction intensified along with growing inequality and changing house structures using a variety of U.S. Census Bureau sources, examining both trends in the income level of new house buyers and the relationship of housing growth to affluent residential segregation. I find striking evidence that new housing did become much more dominated by the affluent, and was increasingly stratifying and segregating at the end of the twentieth century. These changes may exacerbate inequality in the future through opportunity structures linked to place of residence, including access to education and the accumulation of housing equity.","10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.23","Social Problems","Subdivision; Metropolitan area; Economics; Residence; Opportunity structures; Inequality; Development economics; Economic inequality; Equity (economics); Census","en",271,"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/54/1/23/1607521",2190,"Analyzed how housing expansions affected class inequalities in urban areas.","Development increased home values for some while displacing low-income renters.","Regulate urban housing policy to prevent widening inequalities during expansion.","Income poverty",NA

In this article, we use retrospective family life history data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth to examine marital histories of at-risk women. First, we examine current marital behavior and poverty of women from disadvantaged family backgrounds. Second, we evaluate the role of unwed childbearing in linking poverty and welfare dependence between childhood and adulthood. Third, we document the extent to which marriage is associated with economic well-being among socially and economically disadvantaged women, and the extent to which unwed mothers ultimately benefit from marriage. Our results indicate that disadvantaged women who have had children out of wedlock have substantially lower rates of subsequent marriage than other women. Poverty and welfare receipt are substantially lower for those who married and stayed married than for those who never-married or were divorced. The economic benefits of marriage are especially strong among women from disadvantaged families. However, for women who marry, but later divorce, poverty rates exceed those of never-married women. Marriage alone will not offset the long-term deleterious effects associated with unwed childbearing, nor will it eliminate the existing disparity in poverty and welfare receipt among various racial and ethnic groups.","10.1525/sp.2003.50.1.60","Social Problems","Welfare; Sociology of the family; Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Poverty; Marriage promotion; Disadvantaged; National Survey of Family Growth; Family life; Demographic economics; Economic growth","en",221,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.1525/sp.2003.50.1.60.pdf",2192,"Investigated how early union formation affects economic stability among urban low-income adults.","Marriage improved some financial outcomes but did not eliminate broader structural disadvantages.","Avoid overemphasizing marriage in urban poverty policy and invest in systemic supports.","Urban poverty",NA
